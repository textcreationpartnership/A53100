            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label>CHAP. I.</label>
               <item>THE two great Principles of Nature, Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and the Ardent deſire of Happineſs the Foundation of Society and Government. Mr.
<hi>Hobs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in his Impolitick Poſition, That Fear was the firſt Origination of Society. The Origine of Monarchy. The occaſion of the Primitive Wars. The Original of Laws, Monarchs or the firſt Leaders of Colonies the Primitive Legiſlators. The reaſon of the Coercive power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. The Dangerous Error of thoſe who make Law the Foundation of Monarchy: when in truth all Laws were the Conceſſions of Kings and Legiſlators. The Ill conſequences of this miſtake. The Laws of Nature and Nations are of Divine Inſtitution.</item>
               <label>CHAP. II.</label>
               <item>Of the danger of Anarchy. The neceſſity of Laws and Government to prevent it. All People not fit for one kind of Government. Of the three kinds of Government, Democracy, Ariſtocracy and Monarchy. Some conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and neceſſary Animadverſions upon our late
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Government by a Republick.</item>
               <label>CHAP. III.</label>
               <item>The Government of a Republick examined, whether in its own Nature ſo good for the Ends of Society as it is <pb facs="tcp:97680:4"/>pretended. The end of all Government the Happineſs of the Society, it conſiſts in Protection, Property and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Juſtice. Democracy cannot in probability at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe Ends. It obliges the Supreme Magiſtrates to maintain a private ſeparate Intereſt diſtinct from that of the Publick, and the inconveniences that neceſſarily attend that imperfection. Domeſtick Peace not ſecured by Democracy. No ſecurity of Property or equal Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Juſtice in a Republick in regard of the conſtant Factions which are inſeparable from that form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</item>
               <label>CHAP. IV.</label>
               <item>Of Monarchy and its excellency, proved from its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. The firſt Eſſay to a Democracy the Rebellion of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Accomplices. Secondly, from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Monarchy. The firſt popular State at <hi>Athens, A. M. 3275.</hi> Thirdly, Monarchy moſt agreeable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, by anſwering the three forementioned great Ends of Society, and the Happineſs of Mankind.</item>
               <label>CHAP. V.</label>
               <item>Of the Excellency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy: It is not apt to degenerate into Tyranny, the King having by his gracious Conceſſions given Limits to his abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. Of the Intereſt which the three Eſtates have in preparing Bills for the Royal Aſſent, to be by that paſt into Laws, and the great obligation which thereby the People have to Subjection and Obedience.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:97680:4"/>
               <label>CHAP. VI.</label>
               <item>Of the Priviledges of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government: And firſt of the prerogative of the King. The Imperial Crown of this Realm Hereditary, Abſolute and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The greatneſs of his power according to Laws. The Kings perſon Sacred. The priviledges of the People. Firſt, in ſending their Repreſentatives to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, in their Property ſecured. Thirdly, in the excellent and conſtant method of Juſtice. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Priviledges and Franchiſes: In all imaginable care to prevent the growth of the Poor, and in providing for ſuch as are ſo. In committing the Execution of the Laws to ſuch hands as will act with Juſtice: And of the care that is taken to prevent all abuſes of Laws.</item>
               <label>CHAP. VII.</label>
               <item>The great misfortune of Religion, which is made the great pretence to ruine Monarchy. A ſtratagem of the Devil to extirpate all true Religion. The two oppoſites and enemies of Monarchy, Papacy and Presbytery. The opinion of the Catholick Doctors about Papal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the new
<hi>Roman</hi> Creed to confirm it. Papal Supremacy deveſts the Prince of his abſolute Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of his Legiſlative power, and renders Monarchy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure of Poſſeſſion or Succeſſion, by bereaving it of the guard of Laws, of the ſtrength of Alliances, of the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their People. Several Impolitick inconveniences which attend that Religion. Papal Supremacy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the peoples Liberty and Property.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:97680:5"/>
               <label>CHAP. VIII.</label>
               <item>Presbytery inconſiſtent with Monarchy, proved from five of their Fundamental principles. 1. That it is not the beſt form of Government.
2. That the Right of Kings is not from God but the People. 3. That Kings may be called in queſtion for their Adminiſtration of the Government. 4. That they may by the people be depoſed. 5. That they may be puniſhed with Capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
               <label>CHAP. IX.</label>
               <item>Presbytery in reality as great an enemy to Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy and Parliaments as to Monarchy. A ſhort view of their Tyrannick Conſiſtorian Government over the Magiſtracy, Clergie and Laity. Of the latitude and power of Scandal to draw all affairs into the Conſiſtory. Of their kindneſs to their Enemies. The ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Jeſuit and
<hi>Geneva</hi>-Presbyter: Both aim at Supremacy.</item>
               <label>CHAP. X.</label>
               <item>Presbytery as deſtructive of the Peoples Liberty and Property, as it is dangerous to Monarchy and all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Some neceſſary Concluſions from the former Diſcourſe.</item>

Theſe are the two inſeparable Guardians or good <hi>Genii</hi> of Humane Nature; which attend upon every Mortal Man, from his firſt entrance into the World; and which with the moſt ſerviceable fidelity, accompany him through all the viciſſitudes, accidents, and various fortunes of his Life, even to its utmoſt Period.</p>
               <p>AS there can be no greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſuch a Supreme Being which we call <hi>Providence,</hi> than theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which it is impoſſible ſhould be the effects of undeſigning Chance, or fortuitous Atoms, which can never be Parents to what is conſtantly Regular, and without exception Univerſal; ſo there is no doubt to be made, but that the Minds of all Men were ſtampt with this Divine Impreſs, for ſome Ends and Intentions ſuitable to the goodneſs and wiſdom of that All-powerful and moſt excellent Supreme <hi>Being,</hi> from whom they derive their Original: Amongſt many others to which they do contribute, they ſeem to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Addreſs to Society, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Government, thoſe neceſſary Columns and Pillars of the World, <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97680:7"/>without which there can be no ſuch thing as Happineſs on Earth, of which theſe two Principles are the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>AND whoever will trace Society and Government to their firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, will eaſily be convinced, that it was that Love which naturally all men have for themſelves, and their own Happineſs, which firſt invited them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mutual Combinations, and cemented ſeveral diſtinct Tribes and Families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one united Body.<note place="margin">The impolitick Error of Mr.

               <p>BUT after the moſt Wiſe Eternal Being for the accompliſhment of his own glorious Deſigns, had croſſed theirs, by confounding their Language and dividing their Tongues; there was then a neceſſity which obliged them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to divide and ſeparate; and ſo all thoſe who were of one Language, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied and joyned into one Society, and parted from the reſt, who could be of no uſe or advantage to them, in regard their Dialect was not underſtood: By which means they ſpread themſelves into ſeveral remote Regions; and by degrees, the whole Earth came to be inhabited.</p>
               <p>THE people who were thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, in proceſs of Time came to be as different in all other things as in their Language; and ſtill as they multiplied in Numbers, new Colonies were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to part from the old ſtock; and they alſo became diſtinct: Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Societies of Men: Now he <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97680:10"/>who undertook to be their Leader,<note place="margin">The Origine of Monarchies.</note> and Captain-conductor, in their travels and removes, was therefore the chief and principal man amongſt them, and uſually gave his Name and Laws to the Nation or People, which he carried with him. This diſtinction of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and People as it reſtrained the Love and kindneſs (which before their Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was common to all) only to thoſe of their own Tribe and Name, thereby manifeſting the particular reſpect they had one for another; ſo likewiſe it came to diſtinguiſh that Property of Territories and Poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">The occaſion of the Primitive Wars.</note> which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation pretended a ſole Right, Title and Intereſt in, as belonging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto them, and not to any other of their Neighbours. This occaſioned Differences and Quarrels about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their Paſtures, Fields, Woods, Rivers, Springs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as appears both by the Sacred and Prophane Hiſtories. For this reaſon parted <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 13.7,

               </p>
               <p>FROM theſe differences aroſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Wars, hoſtile Invaſions, and Depredations; which did neceſſitate Men for their own ſafety, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Property, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mutual promiſes and obligations, to defend themſelves and the Publick from the injuries of their Enemies; and ſuch were all lookt upon and ſuſpected to be, who had not the ſame Property in the Territories where they did inhabit: and becauſe many times, even whileſt they were at Peace with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they found themſelves infeſted with Domeſtick Diſcords, Miſchiefs, and Injuries, Thefts, Murders,<note place="margin">The Original of Laws and Government.</note> Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and other violations of the Rights and Properties of the members of their own Community; from hence there ſprung a neceſſity of Laws and Government, to prevent ſuch inteſtine Quarrels, no leſs ruinous to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Society, than foreign force; and to reſtrain ſuch amongſt themſelves, whoſe unbounded Wills rendred their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97680:11"/>Actions prejudicial and dangerous to the well-being of the Community, in whole and in every part; as alſo, that by Unity amongſt themſelves, they might be the better enabled to repreſs the Inſolencies and Injuries of their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies.</p>
               <p>NOW generally (if not univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) theſe Primitive Laws were for the reaſons named,<note place="margin">Monarchs and Leaders of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies the firſt Legiſlators.</note> compiled by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Rulers, and in probability the firſt of them, by thoſe who firſt lead the Colony. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> gave directions as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge in all Civil affairs; as for the Eccleſiaſtical he had them under Gods own hand-writing. Thus <hi>Numa</hi> amongſt the
<hi>Romans</hi> was their King and Legiſlator. And in regard experience taught them,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the Executive and Coercive Power of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</note> that the beſt Laws were altogether inſignificant to the greateſt part of Men, unleſs they were intruſted in the hands of ſuch who would ſtrictly look to their effectual Execution; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coercive and executive vertue of Laws was always in the diſpoſal of the ſupreme Magiſtrate; as being the only Perſon or Perſons, who were veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a power, as could give life and activity to thoſe Laws, to <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97680:11"/>which they had firſt given a Being; and to whoſe hands could the care of the Government by a juſt execution of thoſe Laws be more ſafely committed, had it been originally in the People to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, than to ſuch Perſons, as had manifeſted their Wiſdom, Prudence and ability in framing ſuch good, juſt, wholſom, and neceſſary Conſtitutions? But the true reaſon is, they as Supreme over the People had the only Power of making Laws, and to exact obedience and ſubjection to them; by which means, they being the beſt Interpreters of the Laws which they had made, the Safety, Preſervation and Happineſs of the Society, was moſt likely, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, continued and preſerved.</p>
               <p>AND this manifeſts the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental error in Politicks, of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who make Laws to have a priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before Kings and Governors; as if the Laws made Kings &amp; Magiſtrates, when in truth God &amp; Nature veſted Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture with the Right of Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and they made the firſt Laws. This is a miſtake of ſuch dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that if it come to be allowed and Popular, it robs all Kings of the moſt valuable Jewel of their Crowns, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97680:12"/>and which was ſet there by God himſelf who ſet them upon their Heads;

               <p>BESIDES, the very Foundation of ſuch an Opinion is abſurd and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; for there can be no Laws, till there be ſome frame of Government, to eſtabliſh and enact ſuch Laws; nor can any thing have the force or power of a <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97680:12"/>Law, or oblige men to obedience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it does proceed from ſuch a Perſon or Perſons, as have a right to command it, and Authority to puniſh the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or neglect of thoſe who ought to be ſubject to it. And to ſay that this Right is in the People, who by their ſuffrages Elect the Supreme Magiſtrate, is ſo far from mending the matter, that it makes it worſe, and more dangerous: for then the People may in reaſon fairly preſume (when ever they pleaſe to ſay, That the Sovereign Power is abuſed to their prejudice, which was contrary to their Deſign in granting it,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume their own Right, and either keep the Power themſelves, or proceed to a new Election: which is the direct Way to fulfil the prediction of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromantick Head, which was once ſaid, at <hi>Oxford,</hi>

In this all the People have, or pretend to have an equal Right to Power; and the Laws are the <hi>Plebiſcita,</hi> the Votes of the Common people in general. This way of Government is only practicable in ſmall Bodies and Societies of Men; it being impoſſible that populous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of great extent, ſhould either congregate for the diſpatch of every little affair of State, or ever be brought to any agreement about them in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable compaſs of Time: and beſides, they muſt be forced to neglect the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concerns of their Country em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, which are as neceſſarily to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97680:16"/>attended for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, as the greateſt conſultations of State; the Populace being no leſs able to ſubſiſt without Corn, and the other effects of good husbandry, than they are without Counſel and Laws. And ſuppoſing they ſhould thus meet in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, all things would be managed by a tumultuary Faction, rather than by Right and Reaſon, with which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qualifications for Government, the Common ſort of people are as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom well provided, as they are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding any thing that goes beyond the limits of their education in Tillage, Husbandry and Mechanick Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.

And the Original both of Democracy and Ariſtocracy muſt be attributed to Uſurpation; and will be found upon the ſearch of all the Records of Time to have been founded upon Rebellion and a <hi>Regifugium:</hi> which certainly if there were nothing beſides, were a ſufficient Argument to keep all wiſe and ſober men from being in love with ſuch models of Government and Laws, as took their firſt riſe and birth from the breach of Laws, and the apparent ruine of that eſtabliſhment to which they were born ſubjects, if not ſworn vaſſals.</p>

                  </note> and the Senate was forced to Lure the Haggards down again, by gratifying them with the <hi>Tribuni Plebis,</hi> who were certain perſons choſen by the people, to look particulary after their concerns in all the Debates of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

               <p>AND for the States of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> it was an unlucky Precedent, and not much unlike the Reformation they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed to the ruine of the Nobility and Gentry. But if we may credit Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers and Travellers (for I never was there, nor deſire to ſee it) the Country will ſcarcely invite an Enemy to invade, or pay the purchaſe of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and therefore they may be ſafe <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97680:21"/>with any Government, if they can be ſecure amongſt themſelves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can never be a pattern for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a rich, populous, and fertile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who upon that account ſtand in need of the beſt Government, to ſecure us from Inteſtine quarrels, to which all populous places are moſt ſubject, as alſo to protect us from Foreign force, to which the goodneſs and riches of the Country, may give the moſt tempting invitation.

                  </gap> what the extraordinary occaſions at that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97680:22"/>time were, by reaſon of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion brought on by the Factious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publico-Presbyterians,</hi> that the King was obliged at laſt to call and continue that Parliament to grant him ſupplies, which in concluſion took from him his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, Dignity, Crown and Life.</p>
               <p>AS to the Foreſts, of which they make ſuch an out-cry; it is well known, that they are generally Land of ſuch a Nature as admits not of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable improvement in Husbandry; and therefore cannot be better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the publick good and ſafety of the Nation, than in producing Timber for Shipping, which is the only thing which they will well and naturally do: And the keeping of <hi>Deer,</hi> being an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental improvement, and the ſtock they are beſt capable of maintaining, and the King as well as private Men having a juſt right and lawful liberty to employ thoſe Lands which by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance from his Anceſtors deſcended to him, according to his own pleaſure; I know no perſons could be offended at him, but ſuch whoſe covetous Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had an eye to the waſte of them for themſelves, as theſe men had, who to the irreparable loſs of the Kingdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97680:23"/>pretence of improvement made ſuch ſpoil in the Foreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Crown Lands, as ſome Ages of the moſt diligent and induſtrious Husbandry will ſcarcely repair: And which adds to the miſchief, thoſe vaſt quantities of our beſt Timber, with which they uſually over-paid their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, were ſold to ſome of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who have ſince ſhewn us the ſtrength of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Oak.</p>
               <p>AND poſſibly their diſ-foreſting and diſ-parking ſo much ground, though it might turn to good account to ſome of them for the preſent, yet has inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly brought down all the Rents of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom: for our only ſurfeit at preſent ſeems to be of plenty both of Corn and Cattle; we having more <hi>communibus Annis,</hi> than the conſumption of the Nation will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of; and generally no good markets for theſe products of our Country amongſt our Neighbours abroad; unleſs in ſuch a conjuncture as theſe late years of War. Which great plenty has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been much increaſed by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſo many of the Parks of the King, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>So that thoſe chargeable proviſions for Sports and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:97680:23"/>for which</hi> (as they eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flaunt it) <hi>thouſands of Acres, and ſcores of Miles, and great part of whole Counties have been ſeparated from a much better and publick employment;</hi>
                  </q> if the Timber which their waſteful Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice cut down had been ſtanding ſtill, might with far more advantage to the publick have continued as they were.</p>
               <p>AND for Oppreſſion, good God! certainly the World never knew great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thoſe <hi>Keepers of the Liberties of England</hi> were guilty of. It would trouble a publick Accomptant to caſt up thoſe vaſt Summs and incredible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which in leſs than twice ſeven years they raiſed and ſpent to ſupport the worſt of all luxuries Rebellion; and to act upon the publick Charge and Theatre of the Nation, not Maſques and Plays, but the moſt real and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tragedies; and many of them upon Sabbath-days too, as theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Jews</hi> call the Lords-day: So that they might well have ſpared that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt the King and Court. It would be endleſs to recount the Annual Revenue of all the Crown, Biſhop, Chapter and Cathedral Lands, beſides the Money they received for the <pb n="38" facs="tcp:97680:24"/>purchaſes of them even at their Rates, the conſtant and heavy Aſſeſſments, Free-quarter, Plunder, Sequeſtrations, Compoſitions, Decimations, Exciſe and Cuſtoms; beſides the voluntary Contributions, the Bodkins, Thimbles, Rings, Plate and Jewels, which <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> and his confederate Juglers, preach'd and pray'd from the Holy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Zealous Brothers; the vaſt Summs borrowed upon the publick Faith, which ſome of them found to their coſt to be <hi>Fides Punica;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable Ways and Arts they had to ſqueez and drain the Treaſure of the Nation into their bottomleſs Gulph. And I am almoſt confident, that not any three Kings of <hi>England</hi> from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day were ſo expenſive to <hi>England,</hi> as that one prodigal Parliament. And they who now complain of the heavy Taxations (which it has ever been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Republicans are moſt guilty of) muſt know, that we are obliged to them, both for the firſt invention of thoſe payments, and for the neceſſity of their continuance. That ſo the Crown may be ſecured from ſuch exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies as might oblige the King to ask <pb n="39" facs="tcp:97680:24"/>ſupplies from ſuch men, (if theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-men had their deſire and deſign) as had rather take away the Crown it ſelf, than give any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its ſupport and maintenance. And let them but by becoming good Subjects, obedient to their Prince and his Laws, give him demonſtrative aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of domeſtick Peace and Unity, and they may be confident that neither he nor they need to fear any foreign Force or Power: and ſo the neceſſity of theſe extraordinary ſupplies for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Peace and Intereſt of the Kingdoms being removed, they may certainly expect to live in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure free from them, or however from their frequency. And if they will not agree to do this, they may thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for thoſe burthens they lay upon their own and other mens ſhoulders, which they might be eaſed of, if they would eaſe the Government of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant charge it is forced to be at, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it ſelf, and thoſe who are under its protection, from the reſtleſs and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempts of their Party againſt it; and therefore as they can blame no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but themſelves, ſo certainly all the loyal and good Subjects have a great <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97680:25"/>deal of reaſon to complain of them, who are the principal occaſions of thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which lye ſo heavy upon them.</p>
               <p>AS for their concluſion, that theſe and multitudes of other grievance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould be taken away, by turning the <hi>Monarchy</hi> into a <hi>Free State;</hi> Theſe were but fair words and fine promiſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ignorant and credulous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; for a miſerable experience taught us the contrary. And for one King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who according to the moſt mild and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Laws, governed with the greateſt wiſdom and clemency; they ſet up and eſtabliſhed an
<hi>Oligarchical Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Tyranny, like that of the Thirty
<hi>Athenian</hi> Tyrants. And every one of theſe Parliament
<hi>Demarchs,</hi> was as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute by himſelf as the Law of his own Will could make him: Nor could any perſon queſtion either their Actions or Authority, without paying his Life and Fortune, or one of them for ſo great a preſumption. And I remember when the late King at his Trial before their pretended High Court of Juſtice, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned their Authority, they gave him no other anſwer, but that they were abundantly ſatisfied with their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; <pb n="41" facs="tcp:97680:25"/>and from his dreadful example it was eaſie to conclude, that whoever would not be ſatisfied with their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was certain to follow him in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it; and 'tis eaſily remembred how arbitrarily all things were mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the whole Kingdom brought into a ſlavery far greater than theirs, who wear Canvaſs-cloaths and Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-ſhooes, and look like Ghoſts; for they did not only (amongſt the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of grievances which were redreſt) make men look like ſuch, but really made ſuch of all thoſe, whom they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared, ſuſpected or hated.</p>
               <p>AND for their obſervation of the ſituation of the Nation for Trade and Manufactures, it was ſo pretty a new Nothing to pin upon the peoples ſleeves, that it could not but pleaſe extremely: As if all our Monarchs had liv'd in ſuch profound Oſcitancy and Ignorance, that they never knew what Ports, Havens or Creeks they had within their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; or as if the Sea-men knew not without this new Chart of diſcovery, that
<hi>Portſmouth</hi> lay more conveniently for a Trade with <hi>France,</hi> than <hi>Robin Hoods-Bay,</hi> or <hi>John-a-Groats</hi>-houſe in the remoteſt <hi>Orcades:</hi> Or as if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <pb n="42" facs="tcp:97680:26"/>people, whoſe great intereſt and conſtant employment it is from their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leading-ſtrings, were by theſe ſons of <hi>Bacchus</hi> to be taught the art of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture;</hi> and under <hi>Monarchy</hi> could not tell the nature of their Lands, or what Countries were fit for ſuch or ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, or any other thing relating to Trade or Husbandry, but theſe great <hi>Ingenioſos</hi> of the Republick muſt have the honour of theſe happy Inventions, which the people underſtood before far better than they could inſtruct them; as is but too evident to all thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who of late years having their Lands by the univerſal fall of Rents thrown upon their hands, could never make thoſe improvements and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them, which the Ruſticks did, by their better underſtanding of the Lands, and the methods of Husbandry, in which they had their education; which the Gentlemen who are owners of the Land wanted. And for their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care for the Poor, in one ſence it was true enough, they took all the care they could to keep the Nation as poor as it was poſſible; that if ever they ſhould have any ſuch intentions or inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they might never have the power
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97680:26"/>or the purſe to effect their Deſign in bringing back their baniſh'd Sovereign, to his undoubted Right, the Royal Throne of his Illuſtrious Anceſtors: for which purpoſe they kept a continual ſtanding Army at Land, and a Navy at Sea, to the incredible charge, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and impoveriſhment of the Subjects of theſe Realms, both their Friends and Enemies; though they had the policy to lay the heavieſt load upon the backs of their Enemies, if poſſible to break them; and they kept the Loyal Gentry and Nobility ſo poor, that many of them have not been able, or ever will to forget the kindneſs of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the utter ruine of them and their families.</p>
               <p>SHOULD the ſame method be made uſe of with them, ſure then they would make a horrible out-cry; but ſome people may better ſteal a Horſe, than others look over the Hedge; and what was Wiſdom, Prudence and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in a Republick, would be Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Oppreſſion, and Cruelty in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
               <p>AS for the laſt clauſe, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> never had the leiſure effectually to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or encourage the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97680:27"/>How comes our Statute-Law to be ſo full of ſuch Acts, as are for the Improvement and Regulation of all Trades and Manufactures? How come all thoſe Charters and Grants to Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Fairs, Markets, and to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies of the City of <hi>London?</hi> However, we will agree to them, that ſome of our late <hi>Monarchs</hi> have not had the leiſure effectually to look after theſe affairs; but who was it that gave the obſtruction? and how come they not to have ſo much leiſure? Even theſe kind publick-ſpirited Commonwealths-men, who from the very moment that our Nation began to look abroad into the World, and by Navigation to advance the Intereſt of our Country, even theſe great Merchants of Faction, Sedition and Rebellion, began to ſet up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſpoil our Markets, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch diſturbances to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> in the laſt years of her Reign; to King <hi>James</hi> during all his, and to the Royal Martyr, whom at laſt they bought and ſold, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> had ſomething of nearer concern to mind, than Foreign Trade; <hi>viz.</hi> Domeſtick Peace: and found work enough to quench thoſe flames, which they ſaw <pb n="45" facs="tcp:97680:27"/>ready to blaze out, or already broken out in the State; which were kindled and blown up, by the fiery Zeal of theſe hot-headed Republicans: And our Kings by that Charity which begins at home, were obliged firſt to take care of their own Preſervation, which yet (ſo violent was the rage of that unruly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, that they were not able to effect, but all was laid in heaps and aſhes) thank the good honeſt men of the Commonwealth for their induſtry and ſucceſsful pains they took about it, God reward them for it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Government of a Republick examined, whether in its oven Nature ſo good for the Ends of Society as it is pretended. The end of all Government, the Happineſs of the Society, conſiſts in Protection, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and Diſtributive Juſtice.
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy</hi> cannot in probability at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe Ends; it obliges the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrates to maintain a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt ſeparate and diſtinct from the Publick, whereby they manage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs rather for their own advantage, than that of the Community. No ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt Foreign Force can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a <hi>Democratick</hi> Republick, eſpecially in the greateſt Danger. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Peace not ſo well preſerved by it as by
<hi>Monarchy.</hi> No ſafety of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Republick, in regard of their conſtant Factions, nor equal diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments.</head>
               <p>BUT leaving theſe Impatient <hi>furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo</hi>'s, gnawing their Nails for madneſs, to ſee their ſhort-liv'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, with infamy from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97680:29"/>and Earth hiſt off the ſtage of the World:<note place="margin">Republick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its own Nature conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo uſeful for the Ends of Society as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?</note> Let us come to examine the Conſtitution of a Republick way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its ſelf; and ſee whether in its own Nature it is of ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the well-being of Society, as it is by ſome pretended.</p>
               <p>THAT we may do this, we muſt look into the Ends of Government;<note place="margin">The end of all Government Happineſs of the Society.</note> now the End of all Government is the Well-being and Happineſs of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and here I ſhall only concern my ſelf with this well-being in a Politick ſence, and not intermingle any thing of Society as to Religious affairs, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they have a reſpect and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary influence upon the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note>THE Happineſs of any Society does principally conſiſt in theſe three things. Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> In Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in protection from Foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Injuries of thoſe who are not of the ſame Body Politick.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> In Peace and Property ſecured.</note> Secondly, in preſerving Domeſtick Peace, and ſecuring to every Member of the Society their particular Right and Property, free from incroachment or oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> In equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments.</note>Thirdly, in the equal diſtribution of Juſtice to all, according to their Merits, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97680:29"/>by a due proportioning of Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
               <p>TO ſome or other or all of theſe three Intentions, the Happineſs of Mankind in this World muſt be reduced; for no man can hope or expect a greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this mortal ſtate, than to live in ſafety under a Power that is both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, willing, and able to afford him protection; to enjoy with freedom and quietneſs what he can juſtly call his own; and not only to be rewarded &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged for his Induſtry and Diligence in promoting the publick, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence his own private good, but to ſee all ſuch ſeverely puniſhed, who would rob him of his quiet and ſafety, or diſpoſſeſs him of his Right or any part of it, either by fraud or violence.</p>
               <p>IN general therefore, as to all the concerns of Government and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any Society, it muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what kind of ſupreme Power does moſt effectually contribute towards the attainment of theſe Ends? which for this following reaſon a Republick can never do.<note place="margin">Democracy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity attain theſe Ends in regard the Supreme Magiſtrates muſt always maintain a ſeparate intereſt diſtinct from the Publick, which will oblige them to manage the affairs of State rather to their own advantage, than that of the Commonwealth.</note> For whether it be <hi>Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> or <hi>Democratick</hi> by Delegates choſen <pb n="50" facs="tcp:97680:30"/>to repreſent the People, (which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Oligarchy,</hi> and the form our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans dote on) no place in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can be Hereditary; nay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times thoſe places of high Truſt are only Annual, or however but for ſome few Years, and not for term of Life: For (it is their own Argument againſt the long continuance of this Parliament, which is againſt the very foundation of a <hi>Democratick</hi> way)
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>it is highly unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that any one company of men ſhould for many Years ingroſs ſo great a truſt of the People, as to be their Repreſentatives in the Houſe of Commons, and as good men as theſe preſent Members of the Counties and Corporations</hi>
                  </q> (who have as much right, according to the principles of
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,</hi> to have their turn in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) <hi>ſhould be ſo long excluded.</hi> Now whoever is choſen to ſuch places, muſt at the ſame time maintain a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Intereſt of his own private affairs, diſtinct from thoſe of the publick. And there being not only a poſſibility, but the moſt tempting probability of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular advantage to be made of all publick Truſts, where there is Power and Profit, which are rarely to be found ſo ſeparated, but that they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97680:30"/>may eaſily be United; this is a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpur to men of ambitious or craving ſpirits, by all ways direct and indirect, to make court to thoſe employs of State, which if they can obtain, they aſſure themſelves they will become moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to their particular Intereſts, by advancing their Reputation, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and private Fortunes. And the beſt men being not only the feweſt, but uſually leaſt forward, and moſt modeſt, in all probability ſuch perſons will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſit at the Helm of the State, as will ſteer the publick Bottom upon ſuch a courſe, as ſhall be moſt beneficial to themſelves: And then the conſideration of the ſhortneſs of their Power, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly put them upon making Hay whileſt the Sun-ſhine of their Authority laſts; and forcing all private advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with the greateſt expedition and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, both to avoid the danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their preſent opportunity, as alſo to avoid the fear of a future after-reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And in regard it is very poſſible, that the greateſt part of ſuch elective Governours may all be guilty of the ſame deſigns, as well the preſent as thoſe who are Candidates for the future, they will the more eaſily be induced to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97680:31"/>connive at one another; and by a joynt confederacy paſs by all ſuch rapacious arts and methods; and by a common conſent, for their mutual advancement, father the great expences of their Private gains upon the publick Neceſſities, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> themſelves, and to their prejudice to draw it into a precedent for ſucceeding Authorities.</p>
               <p>FROM hence it is eaſie to obſerve with what fidelity the common Intereſt will be ſerved; which muſt almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably fall into the hands of ſuch perſons, whoſe deſigns will be ſo fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AND that this is not only very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but experimentally true, no bare ſuppoſition, but a deadly <hi>Recipe,</hi> to which we can all write a ſad <hi>Probatum eſt;</hi> we ſhall need no further proof, than to take a ſhort review of the tranſactions of the late
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Republick; whoſe great buſineſs was to inrich themſelves, and their Confederates, by the Ruines of others, and by impoveriſhing the whole Nation: And to what Eſtates, by their ill-imployed Power, they did moſt of them arrive, is ſtill viſible; in that, though they were forced to their great affliction, to diſgorge a great part of their acquiſitions, by reſtoring the Crown, Biſhops, Dean Chapter, and Cathedral Lands, to the right heirs and owners; yet ſtill ſome of them had ſo well feathered their Neſts out of the publick ſtock, that they or their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might have lived in the greateſt ſplendor or plenty; if their fear to be taken notice of, or their narrow, penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and covetous humour would have permitted them; or in truth, if the dangerous Curſe upon ſuch as make more haſte than good ſpeed to be Rich, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:97680:32"/>had not like a ſecret ruſt conſumed thoſe ill gotten greatneſs and riches,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.21.</note> the end of which (that Royal writer aſſure us) ſhall not be Bleſſed.</p>
               <p>BUT more particularly, as to the happineſs of any Society by protection from Foreign Force and Injuries;<note place="margin">No ſecurity againſt Foreign Force can be expected from a <hi>Democratick</hi> Republick, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> it is impoſſible that any perſons ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour this ſo heartily, and with that fidelity of reſolution, as to defend it to the utmoſt with their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, who having a diſtinct Intereſt from the Publick, may therefore hope to ſave their own ſtake, and ſurvive the fate of the expiring Government: And this every one who is a ſharer in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Republick may eaſily hope to do; and though he be deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Authority, by an invading Power, that is no greater loſs than in a few years (or it may be days) he is ſure to do of courſe, without ſuch violent means; when by reſigning his place, he muſt be reduced to the condition of a private man; yet ſtill he may hope even under the prevailing Power, to enjoy his Life and private Fortune. Nay further, it is poſſible, that by ſelling the preſent Power he does poſſeſs, and bartering away the publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:97680:32"/>he may arrive at a higher pitch of greatneſs, and a more durable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, than otherways he could ever have hoped for: And certainly there cannot be a ſtronger temptation to ſuch men, to betray the Liberty of their Country, than aſſurances that they ſhall reſerve to themſelves not only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the preſent, but alſo an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional power and greatneſs, and all the advantages of it by ſuch a profitable treachery.</p>
               <p>AND though ſo long as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth can keep a-float, the ſweetneſs of Sovereignty, and the other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the preſent poſſeſſion of, gives them a greater ſatisfaction in, than the largeſt promiſes of an Enemy, of whole fidelity they cannot be abſolutely certain; and ſuch like conſiderations may make them ſtruggle hard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Bird in hand, rather than truſt to two in the Buſh, by reſigning their Power; yet moſt certainly when they ſee it in manifeſt danger of ſinking, (which is the only ſeaſon for trial of Courage and Fidelity) they will be ſo far from employing their utmoſt efforts, to buoy up the Ship of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that they will quit the crazy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97680:33"/>and leaking Veſſel, and fairly tack about in their own private Chaloup, and ſtand in with the next ſhore of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or by ſtriking Sail, and coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lee of the Conqueror, ſave their own Intereſt, and it may be obtain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and advantageous conditions for their early ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, in all <hi>Democratick</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments there dwells a certain dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and miſchievous perſon which the common people call
<hi>No Body;</hi> who always walks inviſible, and ſhelters himſelf from diſcovery amongſt the crowd of Governours: So that when there happens any notable miſcarriage of State, No body knows the occaſion, or Author, or who it was that did it; and if at laſt the publick ſink and periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No body muſt be charged with it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe amongſt ſo many, it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to fix it upon any particular perſon or perſons; and they who are really guilty, will yet have the confidence to proteſt their Innocence; and it may be, that they may appear ſo, will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-enough to charge any ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages upon the oppoſite Faction; which this kind of Government is never without; whereby they do not only <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97680:33"/>ſhelter themſelves, but expoſe their Enemies to the general
<hi>Odium,</hi> and it may be to the popular Rage; and by that means at the ſame time ſecure their treachery and revenge themſelves.</p>
               <p>THUS it was with the <hi>Romane</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who though for above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years they ſtood many violent ſhocks, yet ſtill they were never in a manifeſt danger of an intire Ruine, till ſuch time as the conquering <hi>Genius</hi> of the mighty <hi>Julius</hi> had overthrown the great <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Confederates, who appear'd the defenders of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick: (though poſſibly had victory waited upon their Eagles, they would have made the ſame Quarry of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s did) for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Senate gave way to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror and his fortune, and decreed him a Triumph; the firſt badge of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize, treachery, and ſlavery. And though the ingrateful <hi>Brutus,</hi> and his conſpiring Friends, thought by his death, with three and twenty wounds, to have revived the expiring Republick, and healed thoſe which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had given it; yet were they but ſuch convulſive ſtruggles as did preſage its certain and near approaching death; for no ſooner <pb n="58" facs="tcp:97680:34"/>had
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> the heir of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Fortune and Empire, overcome <hi>Anthony,</hi> but the tame <hi>Senate</hi> reſigned it ſelf and the Government into his hands; and the rather, in regard he permitted them to keep the Name, and to enjoy their private Fortunes, together with many places of truſt and advantage in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of publick affairs; though he transferr'd the abſolute Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from them to himſelf. And there is not the leaſt doubt to be made, but ſince the greateſt, moſt durable, and potent Commonwealth that ever was in the World, did ſo eaſily ſubmit; the leſs and more inconſiderable would ſoon be perſwaded to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>NOR would any of our Modern Republicks be of long duration, were it not for the aſſiſtance of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who to keep the ſcale even, do not think it fit to let them fall as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Territories of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince, leſt by the acceſſion of ſo conſiderable a Power, he ſhould become too dangerous and formidable: to which policy of State, and not to the goodneſs of their Conſtitution they are therefore obliged for their continuance and preſervation.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:97680:34"/>
               <p>BESIDES, to the ſafety of any Government there is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great unity in Councils, and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the conduct of many State affairs; neither of which can with any probable reaſon be expected from a Government which is committed to ſo many Heads, who have all Tongues, and it may be not brains enough to guard them: Nay, ſuppoſing them all wiſe men, they will very difficultly be brought to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame expedients, and it may be the more hardly for being ſuch: Since every mans own reaſon weighs more to himſelf than all the World, becauſe he apprehends and underſtands it beſt. Now they who diſſent from the reſt (which ſome will generally do) out of envy and private Pique that their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was rejected and deſpiſed, will be apt enough to retard the publick affairs, and to divulge the moſt important ſecret Counſels of the oppoſite Faction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render them ineffectual, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their own Intereſt, by ſhewing from events, that their Advice, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Counſel was the beſt.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, many times the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Conſultations amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Judgments are ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, <pb n="60" facs="tcp:97680:35"/>that before they can arrive at a reſolution, many favourable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for action are irrecoverably loſt: And whenſoever any great enterprize is to be undertaken for the defence or ſafety of the Publick, in regard they cannot execute their own Commands, and all be Generals or Admirals, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commiſſions they grant to thoſe high Officers, are from their fears ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and reſtrained, leſt they ſhould by too great latitude of power grow ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, that it frequently occaſions great miſcarriages: And the fear which their greateſt Commanders have to offend ſo many Maſters, though it will infallibly render them moſt cautelous and wary, yet will it moſt certainly make them ſlip the advantages of many ſudden unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected emergencies, which they will be afraid to lay hold of, without advice or command from their many Superiors, leſt the ſucceſs not anſwering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the attempt, they ſhould fall a ſacrifice to an enraged Populace: And thus whileſt they wait for an Expreſs, occaſion, which will wait no mans pleaſure, ſlips away, and ſhews them the bald part of his head, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be laid hold of again.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:97680:35"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Domeſtick Peace not ſo well ſecured by a Republick as by Monarchy.</note>NOR is there a greater probability of expecting Domeſtick Peace from a Republick, which is the ſecond parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular required from all Government, in order to the happineſs of any Society. For where there are many who pretend to an equality and parity in Power and Dignity, there will of neceſſity be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, emulations and animoſities ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the differences of Judgment, as to the conduct and management of all great, weighty or profitable affairs of State: And where all things muſt be carried by majority of Vote, ſince all men naturally have a good opinion of themſelves, their own wiſdom, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ability; every man will judge moſt advantageouſly of his own counſel and advice; for otherwiſe he would not offer it in oppoſition to others; and therefore in all tranſactions mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſuffrages, thoſe perſons whoſe opinion is rejected, will look upon it as a leſſening of that eſteem for Wiſdom and Policy, which they think they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, becauſe they deſire it ſhould be ſo; and by an unavoidable conſequence they will be moſt certainly diſſatisfied, if not exaſperated with thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt the prevailing and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97680:36"/>number. Theſe diſcontents occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the making of parties, entring into ſecret combinations of Faction, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently end in popular Inſurrections, Tumults, and Diſorders, to which, for this very reaſon, whoever will take the pains to obſerve it, ſhall find the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Republick far more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious than any other way. And Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs being generally (if not conſtantly) managed by a prevailing Faction, (who endeavour to ingroſs the ſole Authority and advantage to their party and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites) rather than by an even and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent; it makes that party who think themſelves injured and affronted (by being deprived of the fundamental parity of their conſtitution) reſtleſs and induſtrious in their endeavours to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Intereſt, ſo as to be able to counterbalance the other.</p>
               <p>THUS it was with the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth; when ever the buſie, active, and ambitious ſpirits were not employed in foreign Wars, they were always running into Mutinies amongſt themſelves; Parties, Factions, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Inſurrections, which would have been more frequent and dangerous, had not the policy of the prevailing part of <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97680:36"/>the Senate taken care to cut out Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for them abroad.<note place="margin">A.

And generally all thoſe Tumults and great Diſorders happened whileſt they enjoyed peace and quiet with their Neighbours; which can be attributed to nothing, but that then the Factions, and Factious ſpirits had time to mind their Intereſt at home, whileſt they wanted employment abroad. And that there are no greater or more frequent popular Inſurrections amongſt the modern Commonwealths, is to be attributed to that mixture of <hi>Monarchy</hi> they have in them, which ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances the Factions, and like the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salt of the Body keeps thoſe bodies

For all Factions and Parties are conſtantly for oppreſſion of thoſe who are oppoſite and contrary to them: Eſteeming that the ſecureſt method to keep them under, and to diſable them from oppoſing, or however from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing their Power. So that no man can have any aſſurance of ſafety or property, but by ſwimming down the ſtream of a prevailing Party; and in the beginning of ſuch Factions, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any perſon to propheſie which will be ſo, or how long their power ſhall continue, in regard of the frequent change of Governours. He that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily eſpouſes the falling ſide, is ſure to be cruſhed with them; and if for his ſecurity any perſon ſhall embrace a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Neutrality, he does thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf a prey to both parties; for <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97680:37"/>neither of them will look upon him to be theirs, but will be jealous, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly he is of the adverſe Faction; and accordingly, whileſt he is a declared friend to neither, he will be treated as a ſecret enemy to both; ſo that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there can be any ſuch thing as quiet ſecurity, where Property is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways left to the mercy of perpetual changes and revolutions of Faction, which inconvenience like its ſhadow is the inſeparable companion of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſo long as the Sun of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhines upon it.</p>

               <p>ALL this and much more was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly verified by the Members of the late Rebel Faction of a Parliament, and the Officers, nay, the very common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Army: who were ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Princes in the ſeveral Counties and places of their Reſidence or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that no perſon durſt queſtion any of their Actions, though never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, for fear they ſhould queſtion him for a Malignant, and make his Eſtate a Delinquent; which moſt certainly they would have done; it being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſign that a man was diſaffected to the Government, if he went about to oppoſe their moſt Lawleſs Actions: And to ſatisfie their private ſplene, they would not fail to execute upon him the publick revenge; for he that could not ſubmit to be a ſlave to the Governors, was preſently adjudged an Enemy to the Government; and for that was ſure <pb n="68" facs="tcp:97680:39"/>to ſuffer in his Eſtate, if they were ſo abundantly ſuper-merciful, to let him preſerve his Life in a tedious Priſon.</p>

Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, no ability to diſcharge any Place or Office of truſt, no Integrity ſhall be able to turn the balance of Rewards againſt the heavy charge, or but ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of being no friend to the preſent over-ruling Faction, or their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: So that in ſhort, all Vertue (if we meaſure it by what is rewarded or incouraged in a Commonwealth) will conſiſt either in the artifice of a well manag'd flattery, or a real joyning with that party of the Government which is uppermoſt; without which unmanly compliances no other ſort of goodneſs will recommend any perſon to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city <pb n="70" facs="tcp:97680:40"/>of Rewards; and will ſcarcely be able to protect him from Injuries and Puniſhments. And ſince Vertue is not over natural to Mankind, it is like to thrive but very poorly in a ſoil where it is not tenderly cheriſhed, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſhed with the incouraging Dews of Rewards and Benefits; they being very rare and uncommon perſons, who will eſpouſe Vertue, though the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Beauty in Nature, without any other portion than what ſhe has in her ſelf of excellency and ſatisfaction: And how happy any Society of men in proceſs of a little time are like to be without Vertue, and how long lived ſhe is like to be upon ſo thin a diet, where <hi>(Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitas laudatur &amp; alget)</hi> ſhe is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtarved, I think I need not ſpend time, or trouble the ſober and judicious Reader with arguments to prove and demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>THE ſame may be ſaid of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as of Rewards: And if it ſhall be ſaid, that the frequent changes of the Governours will be a means to prevent theſe inconveniences; I anſwer, it will indeed change the Governours, but not the nature of the Government, which of it ſelf is inclinable to theſe Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97680:40"/>and apt to deprave the beſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into theſe miſcarriages, which do attend the very Eſſence of its conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and though the Governours may be altered, yet it is probable the ſame Faction and Intereſt will bear the ſway, and in all common Policy will take what care they can of the ſucceſſion; notwithſtanding which, it will ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſometimes that the contrary Faction will get into the Saddle; and the more frequent ſuch changes are, it will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of all people ſo much the worſe, uneaſie and inſecure in all the forementioned conſequences of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for ſince firſt one Party will be uppermoſt, and then another; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the injuries they may have received from their Enemies, will prompt them to the like meaſure of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities againſt them, when they are veſted with the power of Revenge; which few tempers have the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reſiſt or refuſe, when it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proportioned to the treatment they formerly received, but neceſſary to keep their own Power and Authority in ſafety and Being.</p>
               <p>SO that upon the whole, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this way of Government by <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97680:41"/>a Republick, is not in any probability of attaining thoſe excellent ends of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which all men propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they enter into it; and the hopes and enjoyment of which can only render any Society durable and happy.</p>

From Gods command in theſe words; <hi>And the man that will do preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken unto the Prieſt that ſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is evident in that the High Prieſt was the Supreme over all the other Prieſts, and therefore this muſt be ſpoken in the caſe of the ultimate Appeal and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; for otherwiſe this command would have brought in a Parity amongſt the Prieſthood; and ſo every little Levite (according to the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine) would have had as abſolute Power, as he who wore the Golden Mitre, and the now unintelligible <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> which as they were then certainly diſtinctions of the High Prieſt, ſo an equality in the Prieſthood was far from both Gods command and deſign in exalting the houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> to the peculiar Dignity of that eminent Office: And matter of fact demonſtrates the truth of this; for <hi>Eli,</hi> who judged
<hi>Iſrael</hi> forty years, did it by vertue of his Office,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.18.</note> and not of any extraordinary Call or Commiſſion that can be proved to intitle him to the Government.</p>
               <p>I know thoſe places are urged againſt the Judges being Kings, that in thoſe <pb n="84" facs="tcp:97680:47"/>days there was no King in
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> But that is not to the purpoſe; for though they had not the Title or Enſigns of Royalty, yet they had all the Power, and their Government was <hi>Monarchical;</hi> and beſides the meaning of thoſe places ſeems to be, that there was at that time no particular Judge, who governed and exerciſed Regal Authority; as alſo that the High Prieſt, whoſe office it was, was ſupine, negligent and careleſs in the management of publick affairs; as is apparent both by the Hiſtory and the many notable miſcarriages which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in thoſe <hi>Interregnum</hi>'s. And though thoſe places ſound ſweetly in the ears of ſome people, who therefore hate Kings, becauſe they would enjoy the ſame wicked Liberties which then thoſe Kingleſs people took; yet how pleaſing it was to God will appear by the remark the holy Spirit always adds to thoſe words, <hi>viz. When there was no King in Iſrael, every man did what was good and right in his own eyes:</hi> And what a brave time that Liberty afforded is plain, in that we never find it mentioned, but either it introduces, or follows, as the occaſion or reaſon of ſome remarkable Diſorder, intimating that they happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="85" facs="tcp:97680:47"/>for want of a King or Judge: which was an effect of Gods diſpleaſure againſt his people, and not of his diſlike of the Government of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or by a ſingle Perſon. The firſt time that it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, it immediately follows as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of
<hi>Micha</hi>'s Idolatry; making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a houſe of Gods,<note place="margin">Judg. 17.6.</note> an Ephod and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim, and conſecrating one of his own ſons to be his Prieſt. The next place that it is mentioned in, leads us as the conſequence of it, to the notable Theft and Sacriledge of the
<hi>Danites;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 18.1.</note> who ſtole
<hi>Mincha</hi>'s Gods, and his Prieſt too from him;<note place="margin">V.

                  <note place="margin">V.
30.31.</note> And gave incouragement to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable defection of
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſin by the Golden Calf of <hi>Dan;</hi> which (as it was the occaſion of it) continued till the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> captivity. In the next place it precedes, and is given as the reaſon of that horrible fact of the
<hi>Benjamites</hi> of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 19.1.</note> againſt the travelling Levite and his Concubine, not much inferior to that ſin for which God deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi>

<hi>Judges,</hi> and follows as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Politick counſel of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who to prevent their perjury by a raſh Oath, gave incouragement and permiſſion to the remaining <hi>Benjamites,</hi> to commit a Rape upon the daughters of <hi>Shiloh</hi> at a ſolemn Feaſt; ſo that here is Idolatry, Theft, Sacriledge, Murder, Civil War, Perjury, and an allowed Rape upon ſix hundred young Women againſt their wills, and that of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, againſt a Popular ſolemn League and Covenant; all admirable, as well as natural and neceſſary effects of there being no King in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> From which miſchiefs I think all people who love themſelves and their peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought to inſert it into their private Litany, with a <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND that God was ſo far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking the Government by
<hi>Monarchy</hi> over his own people, that he did deſign it for them, ſo ſoon as they ſhould come to a ſetled condition in the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> 
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:97680:48"/>is moſt evident from the early prophecy of <hi>Jacob,</hi>

                  <hi>That the Scepter ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, till Shiloh came;</hi> which did plainly foreſhew the Royal dignity of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> Scepter being the Enſign of Royalty, and Law-giving the Prerogative of Kings. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God makes proviſion for their King, and gives ſuch poſitive directions about him: <hi>When thou art come to the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.14,

                  <hi>and ſhalt poſſeſs it, and dwell therein, and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, like as all the Nations that are about me; Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe: One from among thy Brethren ſhalt thou ſet over thee; thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee, which is not thy Brother.</hi> From which place we may fitly obſerve, That God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty reſerves it to himſelf, as his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Prerogative to appoint Kings: And that the Peoples Election is not an Original Title to a Crown. God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, and the people aſſent; and for that aſſent are ſaid to ſet him over them whom the Lord had choſen. And when the men of <hi>Sechem</hi> had of their own heads made <hi>Abimelech</hi> King,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.</note> it proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97680:49"/>accordingly. And therefore, when the people were reſolute to have a King,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.</note> the choice was not made by ſuffrages or popular Election,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.20.</note> but by Lot. Which amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and many other Nations was a Sacred ſolemnity, and Divine Invocation of God, to decide and determine any great doubt or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; as will appear from that place about <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 Sam. 14.41.</note> and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s eating the prohibited Hony; where <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid unto the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael, Give a perfect Lot.</hi> And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi>

               <p>WE muſt therefore conſider Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, as naturally deſirous of peace, and a quiet enjoyment of what they do poſſeſs and challenge a Property in: Now in regard there will of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty happen ſome differences and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about theſe Rights; that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which does moſt eaſily and effectually determine ſuch diſputes, and reſtores them the poſſeſſion of their Peace and Property, muſt therefore be moſt deſirable and agreeable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and univerſal inclination of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, which always has a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this end of Government, as a means to obtain that Happineſs at which all men aim. This final determination of Differences can never be ſo effectually done by Many, as by one Perſon, from whoſe Definitive ſentence there ſhall lye no appeal. For inſtance, In an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy</hi> or
<hi>Democracy</hi> a Difference is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from one inferior Judicature to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till at laſt by appeal it is brought before the higheſt Authority of the chief Magiſtrates; when it is with a vaſt charge and fatigue to both parties brought thither, it is very poſſible that <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97680:54"/>there may be ſuch an equality of Votes, for the one ſide and for the other, that the ſcale of Juſtice ſhall hang without a poſſibility of determination; and whileſt both parties judge they are in the right, and obſtinately refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from it, they both loſe one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end of Government; and if it be of great concern and neceſſity of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, men will at laſt be forced, by the irregular ways of Violence to do themſelves that Right, which they may think Authority will not, when indeed by reaſon of this Natural imperfection it cannot come to a determination. But ſuppoſing this ſo rare a Caſe that it is but juſt poſſible, yet ſtill it is an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al defect in the way of Government; and which cannot by all the art of man, by a double Vote for the Chair-man, be remedied without great dangers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; for if the Beam be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſingle ſuffrage, the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who were over-voted, being ſo conſiderable, and who did believe their ſide and judgment had a better Right, and is injured by the determination, though they muſt be forced to acquieſce for the preſent, yet in regard of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the Governours, they will <pb n="99" facs="tcp:97680:54"/>not be without hopes, but they may have another and more favourable day for it, when the oppoſite party ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decline, or be deveſted of their power: which will likewiſe, if the difference be of publick concern, make them reſtleſs in making a party, ſo as to be able to over-power the other, and bring the determination to their intereſt and opinion; and thus all grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies will roll from one Faction to another, with almoſt an impoſſibility of determination.</p>
               <p>THIS was the true reaſon of thoſe long diſputes and ſeditions at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> the diviſion of their Fields and Commons; and this is the undoubted reaſon, why all our
<hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical</hi> Factious people ſtickle and labour ſo for a New Parliament: even the hopes they entertain, that having made ſuch a party, as will at a new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction advance perſons of their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Perſwaſion, they ſhall be able to make ſome progreſs towards thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations both in Church and State of which they are ſo deſirous. But it is to be hoped, we have ſeen revolutions enough to make us wiſer; certainly we have parted with bloud and money <pb n="100" facs="tcp:97680:55"/>enough to have purchas'd more wit, than to permit a turbulent ſort of ſeditious people to roll us, like <hi>Regulus,</hi> in his nail'd Barrel, till we fall into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine and confuſion.</p>
               <p>BUT now on the contrary, where the Government is in one ſingle Perſon, from whom there is no appeal; as in probability he will not paſs his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations without a great meaſure of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and due examination, ſo it is very unlikely he ſhould be perſwaded to make any alterations of his Judgment, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that there is nothing that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Authority, ſo as to make it cheap and contemptible, like eaſineſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability, frequent changes and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in things eſtabliſhed with due deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration: For this repreſents the things ſo determined, not good, neceſſary o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the eſtabliſhments and determinations made by <hi>Monarchy,</hi> are in probability likely to be moſt durable; and people are likely to enjoy the greateſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, peace and quiet; in regard it <pb n="101" facs="tcp:97680:55"/>cuts off the hopes of many, great, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or frequent changes; to which, for the before-mentioned reaſons, a ſingle Perſon is not ſo liable as a popular State; which muſt of neceſſity be compoſed of diſſenting Parties and Intereſts; and which by its very fundamental Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution muſt frequently change the Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons Governing, and by an unavoidable conſequence many determinations of the former Government. And let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved where you will, this effect is ſo natural, that thoſe perſons who are ſo Zealous for change of Governours in a Common wealth, are always for ſome change in the Government it ſelf; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for effects anſwerable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires from the New ones which they have not tried, which they cannot from thoſe whom they have, and whom by experience they find reſolute to oppoſe their Intereſts and Deſigns. And as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe who in a <hi>Monarchy</hi> are for an alteration in any of its fundamental Conſtitutions, Priviledges, or Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are in reality againſt the <hi>Monarchy</hi> it ſelf: And therefore we may conclude, that they who do ſo induſtriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pull the Mitre (which has ever been a ſure friend to it) from the <pb n="102" facs="tcp:97680:56"/>Crown, deſign by weakening of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to pull the Crown from off the Royal head of Majeſty that wears it.</p>
               <p>BUT further, <hi>Monarchy</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the moſt natural Government, if we conſider how all other Governments do of their own accord inſenſibly fall into it, which apparently ſhews that the <hi>Genius</hi> of Humane Nature grows this way: And though it may by force, violence, cuſtom, or convenience be bent and ſtrained to ſome other form of Government; yet upon the leaſt relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and native liberty, like a bow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, it returns to its natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtate and poſition. Thus we ſee that the ſo famous <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth could not ſubſiſt without a Dictator; an Office that for ſix months had all the Power, and wanted only the Title of a King or Emperor: And when ever the Senate was in danger, <hi>Trepidi ad Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem confugiunt,</hi> their fear made them ſeek for a ſanctuary in the Courage, Counſel, and Conduct of a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; though when the ſtorm was over, the Saint was moſt uſually forgotten; and thoſe ſervices which were above their reward, by their greatneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <pb n="103" facs="tcp:97680:56"/>crimes, and did moſt commonly prove fatal to their great Defenders, who though they had freed the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick from their dangers and Enemies, could not free them from their fears and jealouſies of ſuch grand abilities, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and merit. And even in times of peace and calmeſt deliberation in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Senate, all affairs are generally managed by one leading active Man, who draws the reſt after him, either with the ſtrength of his Parts, or the power of his Party: So that when any publick Debate happens, it is always determined by the prevailing opinion of one Perſon, who by the power of his Eloquence, or the ſtrength of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, induces the reſt, or at leaſt ſo many of them as are neceſſary to joyn with him in their Opinions: For of all the variety of Judgments which may be propounded, one only can be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and that muſt certainly proceed from one Man at firſt, to whom after it is weighed by deliberation, if it be by the major part approved, they give their aſſent, whereby it is eſtabliſhed. Thus when the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> was in a warm debate, <hi>An delenda eſſet Carthago?</hi> whether <hi>Carthage</hi> ſhould be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? <pb n="104" facs="tcp:97680:57"/>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> by ſhewing them the Grapes which grew at <hi>Carthage</hi> not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours before, from the dangerous vicinity of ſuch potent Rivals as had thrice conteſted with them for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Empire, and wanted but only the skill of an <hi>Uti victoria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vincere ſcit Hannibal uti victoria neſcit.</note> to purſue their point to have ſucceeded in the attempt; he brought the whole Senate to an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative determination, That
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> was utterly to be demoliſhed, which was accordingly put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the great General <hi>Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Thus
<hi>Cicero</hi> upon many occaſions both at the Bar and Senate-houſe, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Senate in the determination of differences, by the force of his prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rhetorick, in thoſe Orations of his upon ſeveral occaſions, which are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly famous, as to remain to this day the true ſtandards of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Eloquence. A thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the like nature might be brought to ſhew, That the Reſults of all the Counſels and Debates of a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick are generally, if not univerſally, the effects of a ſingle Judgment and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, to which the reſt accord, and who therefore is <hi>pro tempore,</hi> the
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of the Council.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:97680:57"/>
               <p>BUT there is nothing that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be ſo Natural to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as that all Commonwealths do ſooner or later run back again into that Ocean of Government <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is the Fountain from whence, like other Rivers from the Sea, they firſt took their original: and into which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe wandring Politick
<hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of <hi>Ariſtocratick</hi> and <hi>Democratick</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment do inſenſibly ſlide. Thus all the little Commonwealths of
<hi>Greece</hi> fell at laſt to the prevailing Throne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> run into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: And it is the neceſſary Fate of all Commonwealths, their very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles, as before has been manifeſted, inclining them to it. And the Head of a Faction in a Republick is a King in diſguiſe, or rather enjoying and uſing the Power, whileſt he wants the true Title, he is a Tyrant <hi>Incognito,</hi> in the dreſs of a private Man. And that perpetual ſeparate Intereſt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Parties, which is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from a Commonwealth, muſt at laſt occaſion its fall and ruine, if a change into a better Government may be called ſo. For it is a Maxim in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks as well as Divinity, <hi>That neither <pb n="106" facs="tcp:97680:58"/>Kingdom nor Republick divided againſt it ſelf can poſſibly ſtand.</hi> And if a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth falls, it muſt be either into <hi>Anarchy</hi> and Confuſion, or <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as the firſt principle from which it came, and into which all other forms of Government muſt be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>AND if the State of <hi>Venice</hi> has laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable time above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; or if our Neighbours of the
<hi>Belgick</hi> Union hope to do the ſame; the firſt is obliged already, and the laſt muſt be, if it expects to continue, to that little mixture of
<hi>Monarchy</hi> amongſt them, which Government in its own nature is only capable of Duration and long Continuance: And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the firſt view to all ſuch as will conſider the nature of cauſes by their proper effects; and how ſhort the continuance of the moſt potent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths has been, in compariſon of that of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The ſeveral <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and even that proud <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, who thought her ſelf La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Miſtreſs of the Univerſe, even the longeſt liver of them could not reach five hundred years, and during that term they were many times Governed, <pb n="107" facs="tcp:97680:58"/>and oftener preſerved or reſcued from apparent Ruine, by the Prudence, Courage, Counſel or Conduct of a ſingle Captain, a <hi>Manlius,</hi> a
<hi>Cunctator,</hi> or a <hi>Scipio,</hi> and by conſequence were obliged to that little ſalt of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which preſerved them ſo long from Corruption and a final Diſſolution: But whether we conſider the
<hi>Aſſyrian, Egyptian, Scythian, Aethiopian, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or the leſſer <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the World, we ſhall find that moſt of them, according to the computation of the moſt creditable Chronologiſts, have in their Duration far ſurpaſſed the moſt aged Commonwealths.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Monarchy does beſt anſwer the three Great Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. wherein the Happineſs of Society conſiſts.</note>THE fourth and laſt Aſſertion, That <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the moſt Excellent form of Government, becauſe it does moſt effectually anſwer the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned great Ends of Government, by advancing the happineſs of Society, does moſt naturally flow from the three former. For if
<hi>Monarchy</hi> be the moſt Ancient, the moſt Univerſal, the moſt Natural, Agreeable, and Durable form of Government, it muſt be of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſo, becauſe all People in all Ages, and all Places, have by conſtant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſound it moſt conducive to their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97680:59"/>Happineſs and well-being from the firſt foundation of it to this preſent day: And had there been any other manner of Government eſtabliſhed, or to be eſtabliſhed in the World, by which Mankind could rationally have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to themſelves, either more, or more certain Happineſs, than from and under this; ſo great and natural, ſo conſtant, paſſionate and ardent is the love which all men have for their own Happineſs, that there is no queſtion to be made, but that by degrees all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Race would long before this have hit upon it, and there would have been an Univerſal <hi>Regifugium</hi> over all the habitable Earth. Whereas on the contrary, after trial and experience the moſt competent Judge, which is the beſt Government, we have ſeen many Commonwealths retreat into
<hi>Monarchy</hi> to avoid Miſery and Confuſion; and it is not impoſſible, but the World may yet ſee more.</p>
               <p>FOR the proving of this Aſſertion, I ſhall not need to run over a long repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of all the particulars mentioned in the three great Ends of Government and Society; but deſire the ſober and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader to conſider that which <pb n="109" facs="tcp:97680:59"/>is moſt material in them: which is, That Hereditary <hi>Monarchy</hi> (not Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, which for that reaſon is the worſt kind of it) has no ſeparate Intereſt, or diſtinct deſign from the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; for whether it be Peace; Plenty, Glory, Riches, Trade, War, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Misfortune, the People can have none of theſe in general, but the Prince muſt have his ſhare of them too, ſo that the Prince cannot be miſerable and his People truly happy, nor the Prince happy whileſt his People are really miſerable. And therefore a <hi>Monarch</hi> in conſulting the ſafety, honour, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, peace, and proſperity of his People, does at the ſame time conſult his own Intereſt in every one of them: And this muſt of neceſſity oblige him to act vigorouſly and conſtantly in all his endeavours for the attainment of theſe ends; This will make him look to the equal diſtribution of Juſtice in Rewards and Puniſhments, to encourage the Good, and diſcourage the Ill, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Turbulent and dangerous, who oppoſe the happineſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and by conſequence his own; This will render him watchful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant againſt the attempts of foreign <pb n="110" facs="tcp:97680:60"/>Powers, aſſiduouſly diligent in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Domeſtick peace, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he can have no ſecurity of his own Happineſs, which is ſo inſeparably united to the proſperity of his People. Inſomuch that the State cannot fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by inteſtine Diſcords or foreign Force, but he muſt fall with it: And which rarely happens, though he ſhould eſcape with his Life, yet he muſt part with his Dignity, Dominion and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, without which, Life to a Prince is ſo far from being grateful, that it is ſcarcely ſupportable; and in all the Hiſtory I have read I have only met with the ſingle Inſtance of
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Tyrant, who had the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to laugh after the loſs of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to pleaſe himſelf with play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Rex</hi> amongſt Boys in a School at <hi>Corinth.</hi> And I am apt to believe, that Life would ſcarce be tolerable to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned Prince, were it not that the greateſt extremities of misfortune do yet in Princes as well as private perſons, admit of Hope, the only flatterer that does not forſake them with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: And that faithful Friend brings in Reaſon, Examples and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to perſwade the moſt inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97680:60"/>if they will permit her Audience, that as it frequently has, ſo the Wheel of fortune may turn round again; as that King in Harneſs told the great <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtris.</hi> Of the truth of this we might produce many Tragical inſtances in great Princes, who have choſen to turn the fatal points of their vanquiſhed Swords upon their own breaſts, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to defend their Scepters, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to over-live the diſgraceful loſs of their Crowns and Kingdoms: And having reſigned themſelves to the firſt violences of unreaſoning Deſpair, that has not permitted them patience enough to furle their Sails, and with the Anchors of Hope to weather out the Storm of a ſudden and great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: though poſſibly had they waited upon what they call'd Fortune and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, and we Providence, they might not only have out liv'd their preſent Diſaſters, but might have re-aſcended to their priſtine Glory, Rank and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: Many great Men having by their conſtancy under, and complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their unkind Fortune, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her firſt malicious efforts by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and have been reſerved to a far better, and more Glorious Deſtiny <pb n="112" facs="tcp:97680:61"/>afterwards; a moſt pregnant inſtance of which we have in our <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who in the former part of his life was plunged into as great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes as ever attended a Crowned Head, which yet he overcame with Patience and Conſtancy, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enjoy'd the ſatisfactions of a long, happy, and proſperous Reign. And if my wiſhes may be prophetick, after Ages will find a ſecond Example in the miraculous Adventures of the glorious Reign of our preſent Illuſtrious <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN a word, as the late Uſurping Powers ſtil'd themſelves, The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Repreſentatives of a Republick may be <hi>Cuſtodes Libertatis Patriae,</hi> (I will not as one wantonly, though too truly Engliſh it, <hi>The Jailors of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Country</hi>) but the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and as ſuch, many times commit great Waſtes; but a
<hi>Monarch</hi> is truly <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and as ſuch, muſt have a certain Natural tenderneſs, care and concern for its Safety, Peace and Happineſs, which he looks upon (as it is) to be his own.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:97680:61"/>
               <p>BESIDES, it is to be conſidered, That there is an Art in Governing, which <hi>Monarchs</hi> from their very Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are trained up and accuſtomed to; which makes them by Experience, and the ſecond Nature of Cuſtom, come to a true Underſtanding of the great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and ſecret Reaſon of State; and therefore more ready in all publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, more quick, apprehenſive and ſagacious in perceiving what is condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the Common Good, and what not, than ſuch who have not been Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with all thoſe advantages to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. And then their Continuance for Life, and the ſucceſſion of their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, gives them the deſire of Deſigning well for the publick good, ſafety and ſecurity, and the opportunities of finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was well begun. Whereas all Governours in a Commonwealth muſt at firſt be much to ſeek in all great Affairs; and one may as well expect that a man taken from the Plough ſhould be able to Conn a Ship, and carry her an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Voyage, as that a Perſon, though of the greateſt Natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired parts, ſhould at firſt be fit to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot the Government, or skilful and dexterous in ſo great a Charge as is the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97680:62"/>ſteerage of the important affairs of a publick State. And by that time that he is arrived to a competent skill, he muſt reſign his Place and Power to others as Raw and Unexperienced as he was, and ſo muſt leave that Work which it may be was well laid and deſigned, to the conduct and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Perſons, who poſſibly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand it, nor how to conduct it if they did, or if they do both, yet may have envy enough to croſs or ruine it, becauſe they had not the Glory of the firſt Invention.</p>
               <p>SO that upon all accounts <hi>Monarchy</hi> appears to have been the moſt Ancient, the moſt Univerſal, the moſt Natural the moſt Uſeful, and by unavoidable conſequence, the moſt excellent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for promoting, preſerving and continuing the Common Happineſs of all Mankind.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note>THUS have we taken a view of the ſeveral Governments in the World, amongſt which <hi>Monarchy</hi> juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenges the precedency in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. And againſt which there can be no objections made, but ſuch as may with eaſe be retorted upon any other form of Government; and not only ſo, but many more, and more rational and juſt Exceptions may be made againſt all other kinds of Regiment.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:97680:63"/>
               <p>AS for that thread-bare Topick out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which is ſo perpetually in the mouths of all <hi>Democratick</hi> Factious people, That <hi>Monarchy</hi> is apt to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into Tyranny: It is only poſſible to be true, where <hi>Monarchy</hi> is abſolute, Arbitrary and unbounded: But in our <hi>Engliſh Monarchy</hi> the caſe is clearly different; for though the King be ſo abſolute, that where he has not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded himſelf by his gracious Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his People,<note place="margin">It is not apt to degenerate into Tyranny, the King having by his gracious Conceſſions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Limits to his abſolute Sovereignty.</note> his will is his Law, and is not to be limited by any other Power than that of his own Royal pleaſure: Yet in this particular, the condeſcenſions of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns have been ſo many and ſo great; and thoſe compliances having been formed into Laws, as meaſures and ſtandards of Government; are the Bounds and Limits which <hi>Monarchy</hi> has no leſs prudently than indulgently been pleaſed to give it ſelf; thereby to eaſe the Subjects of any juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fears or Jealouſies which might receive their birth from the formidable redundancy of their abſolute Power: And by this means the Government is ſecured from the danger of falling into an Arbitrary and Tyrannical way of <pb n="117" facs="tcp:97680:63"/>Ruling; and the minds of the Subjects are freed from the dreadful apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſlavery under it. And as by this incomparable method of goodneſs and generoſity in our Princes, the people their Subjects of all degrees and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are the more powerfully obliged to all dutiful Allegiance to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Government; ſo the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf is thereby rendred more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of effectually anſwering all the Ends and Intentions of Society. Let us therefore take a ſhort view of this moſt admirable <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which will diſcover unto us the matchleſs excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodneſs of our preſent. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it is now Eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy Hereditary, and admits of no <hi>Interregnum.</hi>
                  </note>NOW the Excellency of it appears, firſt in that the <hi>Monarchy</hi> is Hereditary and not Elective: But the Son or Daughter, or in defect of them the neareſt of the Royal Line does upon the expiration of the former King ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceed, that our Law does not allow the <hi>Interregnum</hi> of one moments ſpace; and therefore holds it as an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Maxim, <hi>Rex non moritur:</hi> The King of
<hi>England</hi> is Immortal; and the young <hi>Phoenix</hi> ſtays not to riſe from the <pb n="118" facs="tcp:97680:64"/>ſpicy aſhes of the old one, but the Sour of Royalty by a kind of <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> paſſes immediately our of one body into another. And this certainly is not the leaſt of the advantages of our <hi>Monarchy:</hi> For whereever there happens an
<hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum,</hi> not only all Laws are for that time at a ſtand as to force and execution, but alſo all lawleſs and diſorderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons take the greateſt and moſt unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Liberties. Thus at the death of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Heir, they Janizaries and other Martial men rifle and plunder the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at
<hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> and ceaſe not to commit all manner of out-rages, till the new <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> by his publick appearance and bounty to them puts an end to thoſe Diſorders: Which may chance at that new
<hi>Rome</hi> to verifie the ſaying of the <hi>Popes</hi> Jeſter, who being ask'd which was the beſt Holy-day to the people of <hi>Rome?</hi> repli'd, The day on which the <hi>Pope</hi> dies, becauſe there likewiſe the common people by preſcription plunder the Palace of that Cardinal who is elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Pope.</hi> And this cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> which is become a certain expectancy to them, and which they <pb n="119" facs="tcp:97680:64"/>look for at the death of their Emperor, as a priviledge and part of their ſalary, though at firſt permitted them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> may in time prove ſo ill policy, as may occaſion the diſpatch of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, one after another to their great Prophet and his Paradiſe, in greater haſte than ever Nature did intend, or the ſafety of that great Monarchy can allow.</p>
               <p>AND for the diſadvantages of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>Monarchies,</hi> we need not travel ſo far back as to unravel all the <hi>German</hi> Hiſtory, the late ruinous affairs of the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> (which being one of the Baſtions of Chriſtendom ſeems to have been therefore preſerved from the Infidels by a miracle and moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Prince) are capable to ſatisfie any perſon who is the fondeſt of Elective <hi>Monarchy.</hi> And if he has not either depoſed Reaſon the King of his Soul, and elected in its place Prejudice or Paſſion to Govern there; or if he dare credit the Univerſal experience of the World, he may eaſily be convinced of the great, neceſſary, and deſperate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a long <hi>Interregnum</hi> and Elective <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:97680:65"/>
               <p>BUT to proceed ſecondly, from this bounty of our Princes, and for the advantage of Counſel, and that all Eſtates and Conditions who are under the obedience of this happy <hi>Monarchy</hi> may receive ſuch ample ſatisfaction as they can rationally deſire,<note place="margin">Of the Intereſt which the three Eſtates have in preparing Bills for the Royal Aſſent, to be by that paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Laws.</note> the King is pleaſed, according as in his wiſdom he judges it expedient, and the neceſſity of publick affairs requires it, to call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nobility of the Realm, the great Lords both Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (who are two of the three Eſtates of Parliament) to ſit in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, and to adviſe about the weighty and difficult affairs of State. And by their prudent deliberations and ſuffrages to diſcharge that duty they owe to their Prince and the Publick, by preparing wholſom Bills in order to their paſſing into Laws by the Royal Aſſent, for the good, ſafety and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Community: As alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to Royal Authority what former Laws are by experience found to be uſeleſs or inconvenient, in order to their alteration, repealment or abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:97680:65"/>
               <p>THIS priviledge the Spiritual Lords enjoy by vertue of their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Baronies, to which for their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Piety, Learning, Prudence and Integrity, they are by the Bounty of their Sovereign and his Illuſtrious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors elevated and promoted: And they are more particularly in that Place intereſſed and conſulted in all debates which may ariſe about the affairs of Religion and the Holy Church: though they are not at all excluded from a voice in the concerns of all Civil and Politick Sanctions. And this cuts off the hopes of Turbulent, Factious, Ambitious Spirits from aiming at thoſe High pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Truſt and Council in Church and State, to which none are in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable capacity of arriving, who do not tread the paths of ſublime vertue and merit, which are the only ſteps and aſcents which lead to this excellent Temple of Honour: into which any perſons rarely are permitted to enter, of whoſe ability and fitneſs for ſuch high and honourable Offices, a long tract of knowledge and experience, has not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a fair character, and advantageous teſtimony, and where no perſon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, <pb n="122" facs="tcp:97680:66"/>but by the gradual progreſſions of ſeveral lower employs as a ſtate of probation to fit him for thoſe high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements and eminent dignities.</p>
               <p>AND however the malice of ſome people may ſuggeſt the contrary, who are enemies to their Office, and <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> not to be credited, yet is there not the leaſt probability that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould arrive at theſe great Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Honours and Eccleſiaſtical Offices, by the favour and bounty of their Prince, but that they muſt be ſuch as have either highly obliged him by their eminent fidelity and ſervices in a lower ſphere; or who for their excellent qualifications draw the diſcerning and judicious eye of Majeſty upon them; and are by thoſe Honours and Eſtates enabled to be more ſerviceable to his, which is the publick Intereſt, than they could poſſibly be in the meaner conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of private men, and narrow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>I KNOW this is not a Rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Exception: and that it has been the great misfortune of the beſt and wiſeſt of Princes ſometimes to have been miſtaken in conferring Honours <pb n="123" facs="tcp:97680:66"/>and Favours both upon Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical perſons, who in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding actions of their lives have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted that they did not deſerve them: But theſe are rare and extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Ingratitude rather than Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and they muſt be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Artiſts in Hypocriſie and Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who appearing the beſt whileſt they are the worſt of men, do thereby ſometimes deceive the beſt and moſt wary and cautelous Princes; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they muſt have tempers of the baſeſt allay, upon whom the bounty and Majeſty of a Prince are not able to make ſuch impreſſions, as are capable by ſuch high obligements to change their Natures into what he miſtook them for, when he conferr'd his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes upon them: Which doubtleſs no Prince ever does upon any perſon; but he rationally ſuppoſes, either that he does, or at leaſt will moſt zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to merit that bounty and eſteem by all poſſible fidelity and future ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>THE Temporal Lords by a Right of Hereditary ſucceſſion enjoy this Favour of their Prince as a priviledge of their <pb n="124" facs="tcp:97680:67"/>Illuſtrious Birth and honourable Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore being ſenſible from their early Age of the Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to which they are intituled, and the heavy as well as honourable charge they are to ſuſtain in thoſe great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations about publick affairs, it puts their Parents upon the performance of their duty, in giving them that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vertuous Education, which may render them the ornaments of their Noble families, and may qualifie them to be uſeful to their King and Country: to which they are incouraged by the conſideration, that there is no Subject ſo great, but may ſtill hope for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and acceſſion both of Honour and Eſtate, upon the account of ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and merit, either as to Counſel in times of Peace, or Conduct and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in time of War. Which are ſuch conſiderable incouragements to vertue and greatneſs of mind, as will quickly give the young Nobility a delightful and tempting proſpect of the High, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and advantageous Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at which they may arrive, and by what ways and methods they muſt hope to obtain them.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:97680:67"/>
               <p>AND if we could uncharitably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them either to be defective, as to the natural endowments of mind, or apt to be miſ-lead by the heats and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing extravagancies of warm and ſull veins, or the luxuriant ſpirits of youthful years; yet certainly there is no ſuch School either for Wiſdom or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as that Illuſtrious Aſſembly of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility in Parliament. And the repeated wiſe deliberations of thoſe great Senators, are capable of elevating even the loweſt parts beyond all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: And conſtant experience in the conduct and management of the greateſt Affairs, will in a little time be capable of advancing the ſloweſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be prompt and addreſsful in the diſpatch and performance of them. And beſides thoſe conſtant Lectures and Examples which they will there meet with of Juſtice, Temperance, Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, Honour, Fidelity, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, muſt (if any thing be capable of effecting it) be able to change the very Natures of Men of Reaſon; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to civilize and cultivate, but to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize tempers more fierce, wild and extravagant, than it is almoſt poſſible <pb n="126" facs="tcp:97680:68"/>for any Noble perſon after ſuch elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Education, to be found guilty of.</p>
               <p>AND though it is the envious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the vulgar of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and particularly of ſome who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by the Art of Detraction, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an opinion that they are the only Saints themſelves, from the great and religious enmity which they maintain and propagate againſt Miters, Coronets and Crowns) to be curious in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing which may leſſen their Superiors; and that it is very rare to hear them ſpeak with that duty and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration which becomes them, in their cenſures and opinions of thoſe who are above them either in Birth or Fortune; yet it ought to be attributed to the height of their quality, which expoſes them to ſuch a publick view, that their very privacies and retirements can ſcarcely deſerve thoſe names, rather than to any extraordinary miſcarriages they can be accuſed of, by which they do juſtly purchaſe the ill opinion of thoſe envious Detractors, the Malicious poiſoners of a credulous Populace. And probably tatling ſame the greateſt of all <pb n="127" facs="tcp:97680:68"/>Liers, of which the Poet ſays moſt truly,
<q>— vires acquirit eundo,</q> does not a little contribute to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in multiplying and magnifying, even ſmaller miſcarriages, till by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and the inſenſible addition of every Relator, they ſwell into the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the greateſt crimes. And it is not to be doubted, but that there are few of the common rank of people, but according to their talent and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, either do, or have exceeded the Nobility in thoſe extravagancies, which with ſuch unbecoming freedoms they condemn them for: And had they the full reins of Liberty and Revenue which the other do poſſeſs, there is little queſtion to be made, but wanting the advantages of ingenuous Education, they would far out-do them; and which though poſſibly under their preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they now may do, yet their private condition conceals their vices and follies as well as their Names, which are confined to the knowledge only of a few of their obſcure confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. <pb n="128" facs="tcp:97680:69"/>Thus the Sun and Moon, thoſe noble Luminaries of the World, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer the leaſt Eclipſe or Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Light, nay there is not the leaſt ſpot or freckle that happens to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their glorious faces, but the whole Earth ſtands gazing at it and takes notice of it, whileſt the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Plebeians</hi> of the Sky, though ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame accidents, by reaſon of their ſmalneſs and obſcurity, not only paſs unregarded, but are ſaid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and travel in the milky way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
               <p>I WOULD not be thought to write this as an encouragement to any thing that is not Generous, Honourable and Vertuous in thoſe Illuſtrious ranks of men; nor would I debaſe my ſelf to flatter them either in, or into any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, or unmanly vices, though I were aſſured that I ſhould thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not only their favour, but their Honours and Eſtates. My intention is perfectly the effect of a true and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Zeal to ſerve them, and of that real veneration my duty obliges me to cheriſh for them. And to give the young Nobility this Sea-mark, that ſo
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97680:69"/>they may diſcover where the rock lies under water, which has ſplit their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, whileſt their ſails were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt proſperous gale of a full blown Hope, that ſo by the knowledge of it they may endeavour to avoid it. As alſo to do them that reaſon to the World, which I know they do deſerve, though through the prejudice which is thrown upon their fame by a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſanctimonious but really envious Populace, it is rarely their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to meet with or obtain it.</p>
               <p>BUT to proceed, Thirdly, The Sun of Majeſty does not confine his kind beams only to the Stars of the firſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, but diffuſes his light and warm influences to the meaneſt and loweſt of his Subjects. Inſomuch that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt ſphere of the Populace is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and receives a moſt agreeable and harmonious motion from the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of Royal Authority. For by his gracious Writ of Summons the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe of Commons, the laſt of the three great Eſtates of the Kingdom are convened and aſſembled, and act as the Repreſentatives of the whole Body of the Commons of the Nation, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="130" facs="tcp:97680:70"/>to the preparing Bills, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the concurrence of the moſt Honourable Houſe of Lords, are as their joynt Petition, tendred to his moſt Excellent Majeſty, that by his Royal Aſſent they may become neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and obliging Laws, to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of what degrees or conditions ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And for this very reaſon the Statute Laws of
<hi>England</hi> muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ſuppoſed to be moſt eaſie, uſeful, and convenient for the People; being ſuch Rules of Government as are not only eſtabliſhed with their good liking, but with their own free choice and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary conſent,<note place="margin">The great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which the People have to Subjection and Obedience.</note> and according to the beſt method of their own freely delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and debated conſideration and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, whereby they may be beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to every mans private, and the publick Intereſt and advantage of the Nation. And hereby all juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion not only of diſobedience but complaint are removed and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince no people can in reaſon be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with thoſe Laws and Rules of Government which are of their own choice, preparation and approbation, and to the eſtabliſhment of which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97680:70"/>contributed all that lay in their power to do, they are therefore more ſtrictly obliged to ſubmit and yield all willing and ready obedience to them.</p>
               <p>FOR this great Employment from every County, and from thoſe ancient Burroughs whoſe Charters (the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Grants of former Kings) entitle them to that Right by choice of the Freeholders and Freemen, perſons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their Ability, Integrity and Judgment in the affairs of the Nation in reference to Foreign Trade and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Manufactures or Improvements of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch whoſe Eſtates give them a great Intereſt in promoting the Well-being of the Community, and a near concern for the good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, are or ought to be Elected as the peoples Repreſentatives to be Members of that Honourable Senate.</p>
               <p>AND though ſome reſtleſs, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and turbulent
<hi>Democratick</hi> ſpirits, and others of mean and ungenerous principles have of late endeavoured to deprave the ancient and excellent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom of Elections, by ſome mercenary methods of courting the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97680:71"/>people agreeable enough to low Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and ill deſigns, though utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the high ſpirits of the ancient and honourable
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry, as well as the gravity and ſobriety of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Burgeſſes, yet it is to be hoped that neither the practice nor its threatning conſequences are intail'd upon them and their poſterity. I am abundantly ſatisfied that theſe inconveniences are not unknown to the beſt, and that it is the difficulty of doing it, rather than want of deſire or reſolution, which may hitherto have deferr'd the redreſs. I am not willing by an over-zealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to erect a Trophy upon the Ruines of my modeſty; and if I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the limits of the decency which ought to bound every private quill, I hope it will be attributed to fear and apprehenſion of danger, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times authorizes, or at leaſt renders a freedom pardonable, which it may be cannot be reconciled to the ſevere rules of prudence or diſcretion. And that this practice is not without moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt danger, former experience, in whoſe ſevere School we have lately been diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd into an unhappy certainty, does <pb n="133" facs="tcp:97680:71"/>ſufficiently convince us. Since it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond denial, that we owe all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate misfortunes of our late dreadful revolutions to this great Art of Faction and making a party: which by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ſucceſsful Induſtry of ſome people gave a prevalency to thoſe Men, who being in their principles oppoſite to the Intereſt of the Church and Crown, in a ſhort time by their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices ruin'd and overturn'd them both. And the preſent proſpect of the reſtleſs and unwearied Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Faction, may likewiſe make it appear no leſs neceſſary now; it having always been eſteemed as a wiſe and approved Maxim in the Phyſick of the Body Politick as well as Natural, in times of ſpreading and Epidemick Contagions to preſcribe <hi>Prophylacticks</hi> as well as <hi>Alexipharmacks,</hi> one of which has and ever will be,

               <p>THERE is nothing does ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate the excellency of a Cauſe as the noble effects which it does produce; nor can any thing ſo plainly ſpeak the goodneſs of a Covernment as the mutual happineſs of the Governed and Governours.

And for my own particular, I am not ſo familiar with Majeſty as to approach it, though but with my Pen, without ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tremblings of my hand, occaſioned by that awful veneration which the very name of Dread Sovereign raiſes in my mind. Nor can I believe that Great things and greater Perſons are to be treated, or ſo much as treated of, but with the greateſt reſpect and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, caution and the moſt profound ſubmiſſions. And therefore, if whileſt I endeavour to diſplay their amazing glories and excellencies, with a deſign of rendring them the greateſt ſervices I am capable of I draw them in the Miniature of this ſhort Diſcourſe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome faint hopes, that the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſo ſmall a Piece being ſo much more pardonable by being little, will be attributed to my timerous haſt: Fear is a paſſion which is apt not only to diſorder the Fancy, but even to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Reaſon it ſelf: And it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common for great Perſons, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirits, to pardon with a gracious

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97680:87"/>that no perſon can deny it, who will not at the ſame time manifeſt ſhameleſs Confidence, and notorious Ignorance of that Conſtitution and thoſe Laws the benefit of whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he does continually enjoy; it does appear that there can be nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to complete the happineſs of all ſorts and conditions of Men, who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this admirable Government, but the knowledge of it, which would bring them to a real belief that they are the moſt Happy People in the World; that ſo they might be ſatified of the great obligations they have to Unity amongſt themſelves, and all ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances of Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Supreme Authority in thoſe Laws, which are ſo much both their own Choice and Intereſt: which is the only rational way to continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> increaſe and ſecure their Happineſs, and to render this moſt happy Government impregnable againſt all the malicious attempts of theirs, becauſe its impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies.</p>
               <p>ONE would difficultly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (if unerring Experience did not afford an unqueſtionable conviction) <pb n="165" facs="tcp:97680:87"/>that it were poſſible to find either ſo great Malice or Miſtake, as could be capable to tranſport any perſon ſo far beyond the confines of Reaſon, as to endeavour ſo much as in a thought, much leſs by their actions, to alter or ſubvert a frame of Government ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and in all its parts moſt exact and excellent. And if nothing beſides were able, one would judge, That the impregnable ſtrength of ſo well a built and fortified a Conſtitution, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſcourage the moſt daring Villains and deſperate Natures amongſt Mankind. To attempt ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, as appears in all Humane proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the very next thing to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be effected, muſt ſuppoſe the Deſigners to act according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not of hope or reaſon, but of a brutal Rage, or rather deſperate Fury, and revengeful Frenzy. For an impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was once a mighty <hi>Monarch,</hi> to daſh out his deſpairing brains againſt the Bars of his Iron Cage, admits of ſome reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; but for people to do it who are free and happy, is certainly a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable madneſs, And whoever <pb n="166" facs="tcp:97680:88"/>goes about to undermine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a Pile of that weight and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they do unfortunately ſucceed in the ſtrange attempt, cannot in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability expect to rejoyce in thoſe Ruines, which in all likelihood will fall upon them and cruſh them to Atoms: And certainly only ſuch who have loſt the eyes of their reaſon, can be ambitious of ſuch a rude <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> as that of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who pull'd down the houſe to be revenged of his enemies; and thereby gave himſelf an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Monument amongſt the periſhing croud. And one would believe that Eternal infamy were no tempting Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph to be written upon ſuch Tombs of Rubbiſh as are rais'd by the fall of the State and Government. But if they do not ſucceed, but happen from their high attempts and lofty expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to fail of their deſigns and fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the well-built Pyramid, they muſt unavoidably run the fate of
<hi>Phaeton,</hi> and cool thoſe flames which their wild ambition has thrown abroad in the World (by attempting upon the reins of Government) in the Ocean of Ruine. Notwithſtanding all which affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="167" facs="tcp:97680:88"/>conſiderations, yet ſuch men there are (if they who are diveſted both of Reaſon and true Religion can deſerve that Name) or rather Monſters in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, and too many of them there are to be found: Inhumane and Unnatural! whom no Happineſs is able to content, but what is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ruine and Miſery of others; No Government can pleaſe, but whoſe foundation is laid upon the ſubverſion of the preſent, and cemented with bloud: And whoſe very principles are deſtructive of themſelves, becauſe of all Government, Society and Happineſs in this World.</p>

                  </note>BUT the greateſt of all our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes is, That theſe dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our preſent Peace and future Happineſs pretend to draw both their Principles and Practice, not from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, but Religion, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was deſigned by the Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to oblige men to Obedience, and intended to be the great ſupport of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. See the unhappy Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of over-heated Brains, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or Fancy rather under that Sacred Name) run out of its Wits! which by <pb n="168" facs="tcp:97680:89"/>the late diſcovery of New Regions of Faith, and New Lights of Religion, has given ſuch diſturbances to the Old; and can force that which in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is undoubtedly the greateſt ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Crowns, and the Intereſt of any People, to become the greateſt Traitor to the one, and Treachery to the other: which can make even Religion, not only ſtoop to wicked Deſigns, but turn <hi>Renegado,</hi> and deny the Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith of Chriſt. But alas! it is not Religion: That is all Bright, Peaceful and Innocent! It is a Cloak, a Vizor, a Form of Godlineſs, or an appearance without the Power, the Soul of Piety, which Counterfeit and Impoſtor works all theſe diſmal effects. That Wiſdom which is from above, is like its Author, and the bleſt Regions from whence it comes,<note place="margin">5. Jam. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Pure and Peaceable, full of Good works: But that is Earthly, Senſual, Deviliſh, which is the Mother of our Strife, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and every evil Work:</hi> And however with the moſt fair appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſanctimonious pretences, it may deceive the Unwary, and cover the Malicious, yet certainly it is one
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97680:89"/>of the moſt refined ſtratagems of the Primitive Arch-rebel the degraded <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that implacable Enemy of Mankind, and the perpetual envious diſturber of their Happineſs: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence of Religion, he does but too ſucceſsfully endeavour to ruine it; and whileſt he perſwades the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, that there is no other deſign in a New Faith, or thorough Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to repair the Houſe, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knows he ſhall pull it down, or at leaſt deface it. Thus ſome unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing people, overcome with the old temptation, whileſt they would know Good and Evil, and become like Gods, by taſting the forbidden Apple of State, they run the hazard of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and poſterity become like the Tempter, malicious and miſerable, to a degree below the Beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>NOR can this old guilded Serpent, with all his Generation of Vipers,<note place="margin">A ſtratagem of the Devil to extirpate all true Religion.</note> by feeding upon the Mother that brought them forth, propoſe any Way more probable to undo the Reputation of the true Religion, than by making others as like in appearance as may be, and <pb n="170" facs="tcp:97680:90"/>endeavouring to obtrude their ſhining and painted Glaſs upon the World, as the true and ineſtimable Jewel of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. By which Artifice, the true and innocent Religion ſhall become charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with the Wars, Tumults, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diſorders of the World; which in reality are the products of the Counterfeits: And whileſt by Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Rebellion, Diſloyalties and Treaſons, Plots and Conſpiracies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretences of Conſcience, ſuch diſturbances are given to the ſafety and ſecurity of Sovereign Princes and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, a fair train is laid to blow up all Piety, and to introduce Atheiſm, and at once to extirpate all Religion from the minds of Men, who muſt look upon it as a pernicious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, which pretends one thing, and acts another directly contrary to it: And if once men come to hate it, and wiſh there were no ſuch thing in the World it would not be long before it would be ſo; nor can any thing bid fairer to effect this, than ſuch Actions as may perſwade the <hi>Monarchs</hi> of the Earth to entertain averſions againſt it, as a principle which runs their Subjects
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97680:90"/>into Mutinies, Diſobedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and which intrecches too much upon the Royal Prerogative, by a continual cutting off the skirts of the Robes of Majeſty, and not being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways innocent of attempting againſt their Lives and Crowns.

               <p>THERE is no creature ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that is without its particular enemies, to whoſe violences, that does often give encouragement and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Neither is there any vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its oppoſites and extremes, which manage a continual either open hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſecret war againſt it.

Undoubtedly it is lawleſs Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and inſatiable Deſire of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, which are the true ground and foundation of all Rebellion and Diſobedience, though Innocent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Chriſtian Liberty are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made the cloak of this malicious Wickedneſs, and uſurping Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the root of all evil: which are conſtantly made uſe of by all ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, who, as S.

               <p>FROM this new confeſſion of Faith theſe two Corollaries follow, Firſt, That all Chriſtian Kings, Princes and People owe unto the
<hi>Roman</hi> See, all Temporal Obedience. For there is no limitation, but Obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi> in general and incluſive words is made a neceſſary Article of Faith, and where any thing is ſpoken in general words, it is always to be conſtrued to extend to <pb n="177" facs="tcp:97680:93"/>all that can be ſignified by thoſe words, in favour of that Power which it is deſigned to declare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, If no man can be ſaved out of that Faith which are the expreſs words of the Oath, Kings and Emperors not being excepted; the
<hi>Pope</hi> is made the Supreme upon Earth, and he can be no Chriſtian who does not believe him to be ſo, by which determination this is made a Hereſie of the blackeſt Dye, and ſubjects all perſons who are guilty of it to all the Cenſures of the Church, Excommunication, Interdiction, and all their dreadful conſequents both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>NOR will it be of avail, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cover the dangerous fraud of the general words which are of ſuch ambiguous latitude, by pretending to reſtrain them and the <hi>Papal</hi> Power only to Temporals,
<hi>in ordine ad Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualia.</hi> Since all Humane Actions, being either Vertuous or Vicious in ſome degrees more or leſs, muſt be brought within the Verge of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <pb n="178" facs="tcp:97680:94"/>Supreme Power and Juriſdiction: And which muſt therefore finally veſt the <hi>Papacy</hi> with a moſt abſolute unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.

               <p>LET us now conſider how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent this fundamental Article of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith is with the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the Prince, and the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the people, which we ſhall eaſily diſcover by conſidering the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Inferences which are neceſſarily to be deduced from it.</p>

If the King be Supreme, the <hi>Pope</hi> ought to obey him, if the <hi>Pope</hi> be Supreme, the King owes obedience to him, and by plain conſequence is no more than a greater and Crowned ſubject, and muſt have a dependence on the <hi>Papal</hi> power; which if it be admitted only purely in Spirituals, will yet take away the Divine Right of Kings; and if once
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97680:94"/>you remove that foundation, down goes <hi>Monarchy:</hi> For it muſt have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Divine or Humane right; if their right be from Men, as it muſt neceſſarily be if we admit a ſuperior to it, or a dependency upon any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Creature, the power upon which it has a dependency and is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to it, may whenſoever it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes reaſſume that Right. Which would render the condition of Kings more unhappy, becauſe more uncertain than that of the meaneſt private Man, by ſubjecting them to the
<hi>Caprichio</hi> of any humane Authority, whereby they may be depoſed; a degraded greatneſs being more ſubject to the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward agonies and affliction, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contempt, than downright po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and no miſery being comparable to a <hi>fuiſſe foelicem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NAY further, if once you admit this ſuperiority of the

               <p>LET us now come to take a view of the Younger Antagoniſts of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, The Popular Supremacy of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, that <hi>Lerna Malorum,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived <hi>Hydra</hi> of the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> with its many headed Progeny, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Quakers, Levellers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which Unnatural off-ſpring of this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter are as kind to their Dam as Vipers, and as inconſiſtent with Monarchy as they pretend to be with the Papacy (with which Presbytery juſtles for Univerſal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) or any of them with Loyalty, Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, or true Religion: for that commands all men every where to be blameleſs <pb n="202" facs="tcp:97680:106"/>and harmleſs as the Sons of God; to which practice of Innocence, however their Appearance may deceive the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous and Ignorant, their Principles and Actions, even thoſe they call Religious, being done in contempt of and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a lawful Authority (for a good Action may become ſinful by being ill done) are as contrary as Light and Darkneſs, Blackneſs and Whiteneſs, Hell and Heaven, or if there by any thing that can poſſibly be more infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>AND to make this appear ſhall be my Task, <hi>Canis ad Nilum,</hi> remembring they are Crocodiles, whoſe very ſighs and tears are treacherous. There can be no great pleaſure to dwell among Lions, and as the ſame Royal Writer tells us, it is unſafe as well as uneaſie to ſojourn under the Black Curtains, and to dwell with them that hate Peace, amongſt ſuch as are ſet on fire, even the Sons of Men, whoſe Teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their tongue a ſharp Sword. We will therefore examine their Principles and Practice, both which we ſhall ſee keep a moſt harmonious Concord, if that can be, where no other thing but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord dwells.</p>

                     </note> I do affirm, That Ariſtocracy or one compounded of that and Democracy, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:97680:107"/>is that which does far excel all the reſt; though not ſo much for it ſelf as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it rarely happen that Princes are ſo moderate as not to deviate from what is Juſt and Right; or furniſhed with ſo much<note n="*" place="margin">Tanto acumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> ſharpneſs of Wit and Prudence, as to ſee when all is well: The vices therefore and defects of Men, make it more ſafe and tolerable to have the Reins of Government committed to more hands than one.</q> Here is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid by the perpetual Dictator of Presbytery, to aboliſh all Monarchy, and to introduce into the World an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratick Democracy in its Room. He tells us, it is by far the more excellent form of Government: and he indeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Poſition by the moſt diſgraceful, ſaucy, contumelious reflexions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies upon all Princes. In general they want both quickneſs of Wit and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to manage affairs of State, or to know what is beſt for the publick; that commonly they are defective, vitious, and debauch'd, and that therefore their Government is not very ſafe or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that they are not fit to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Reins in their hands, but the Adminiſtration of affairs ought to be committed to more than one.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:97680:107"/>
               <p>IS not here a plain text for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to write their black Comments and bloody Rubriques upon? Monarchy is neither good, ſafe, nor tolerable, Kings have rarely either Wit, Prudence, or Honeſty, (and our Modern Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans add Money neither, which they may ask long enough before they will ſupply them by their good wills) but are either vitious or defective; <hi>ergo,</hi> That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ought to be aboliſhed, and Ariſtocratick Democracy (which good Man! he will not deny but it is the beſt) ought to be eſtabliſhed, as he proceeds;<note place="margin">Idem ibid.</note>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">That ſo they may mutually help one another, teach and admoniſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (all the Arts of Rapine and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) and (adds he) if any one exalts himſelf more than he ought, there may be more Maſters to repreſs his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence.</q> Kings it ſeems have no Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net or Privy Counſellors, no Parliaments to adviſe with, no great and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, nor ever a faithful Friend or prudent Counſellor, to be helpful to them, in <hi>Arduis Regni,</hi> in any difficult occurrences of Government, and not ability enough to do it themſelves.

<q rend="margQuotes">accompanied with Moderation, is eſtabliſhed for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; So I think that People moſt happy who enjoy that condition of Life and Government.</q> Do you think ſo, good Mr.
<hi>John?</hi> I wiſh you had thought twice on't for the Proverbs ſake, that ſecond thoughts are beſt, before you had as an Inſtitution, Printed this fatal principle of Liberty of Conſcience and Moderation as you call it, or rather it is to be wiſh'd you had never thought ſuch a pernicious Poſition. I am ſure though after all your muſing your thought was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97680:108"/>not worth a penny, we have paid dearly for your thinking this Liberty for us; and wanted but little of falling by it into the greateſt ſlavery that can be thought of, called Presbyterian Liberty and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State, and by their reſtleſs indeavours, one may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that ſome of your party and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion will want of their wills, but they will both think us and act us into the ſame or a worſe condition again, if God be not the more propitious to us: and it is but little comfort for us to think after all the miſchiefs we have and may ſuffer for this thought, that the Diſciples of this great Maſter will repay us with a ſecond thought as bad as the firſt, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Fools, a <hi>Non putaram,</hi> we did not think it would have come to this, or who would ever have thought it?</p>
               <p>BUT he goes on to puſh them vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly forward in the enterprize; and his following words are able to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the moſt languiſhing Presbyterian, and to revive the fainting good Old Cauſe, with a dram of the Bottle of his <hi>Aqua Mirabilis,</hi> otherwiſe called by the Sons of <hi>Hermes, Aqua Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> Stygian Water or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> which will eat the Gates of Braſs, and the <pb n="208" facs="tcp:97680:109"/>Iron Bars of Monarchy in pieces.<note place="margin">Idem ibid.</note>

               <p>This double-barrel'd pocket Piſtol did not more certainly hit King <hi>Edwards</hi> Life, than theſe words of <hi>Calvin</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Presbyterian Faction, did contribute to the late horrid Rebellion, ruine of the Church to introduce this <pb n="209" facs="tcp:97680:109"/>Liberty and Moderation, Extirpation of Monarchy, Murder of Sacred Majeſty in Perſon, in Fame, and in Effigie; which laſt I ſaw with my Eyes in the <hi>Old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> where the Statue of the Martyr being pull'd down, triumphant Treaſon was in golden Characters exalted and written in theſe words, <hi>Exit Tyrannus, Regum ultimus, Anno Libertatis Angliae primo.</hi> Such a profanation of the Image of the Deity (as all Kings are) as it ſeems nothing but thoſe dreadful flames which ſince laid it in aſhes could purge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate, and as the concluſion of all from hence ſprung the model of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, The

<hi>England,</hi> as in all their publick Inſtruments they falſely ſtil'd themſelves.</p>
               <p>AND that this was the natural and eaſie conſequence, or to ſpeak in their Cant the Uſe of Exhortation and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is plain: for it is lawful for all men to ſeek after Liberty, eſpecially of Conſcience; The People of theſe Nations are a freeborn People: It is the greateſt felicity, and they the moſt happy People who may enjoy this Dear Liberty; all men are bound to promote their own Happineſs, they cannot do too much to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97680:110"/>preſerve it, and if they do indeavour moſt ſtoutly and conſtantly to maintain it, by War and Rebellion, they do no more than their duty does command them. The King was a Tyrant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Prerogative, did daily intrench upon the Peoples Priviledge and Liberty, he had a deſign to enſlave them; The Commons were oppreſſed both in their Civil and Religious Rights; The Parliament were the Peoples Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and from them had a power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Liberties, and that ſtoutly, with Sword and Piſtol, Powder and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and to call the King to an account, and to judge him for theſe miſcarriages, as from <hi>Calvins</hi> own words I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhow. The King had rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy to reign, as from his words and <hi>Knoxes</hi> another of their fiery Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors I ſhall ſhew; Therefore they might in defence and for the preſervation of their Dear Liberties, eſpecially Liberty of Conſcience and Moderation, and the Rights of the People, make War againſt him (for <hi>Preces &amp; Lachrymae,</hi> the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Tears thoſe ancient Arms of the Catholick Church are of no requeſt or force with the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi>) they might by the incouragement and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <pb n="211" facs="tcp:97680:110"/>of their proſperous villanies alter the eſtabliſht form of Government, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, depoſe the King, take away his Crown and Life, baniſh his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and the whole Royal Family, which was a favour ſome of them never intended; for I have heard it confidently reported, that it was hotly urged by ſome of thoſe Barbarous Villains, to put his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> Apprentice to ſome mean Mechanick Trade, thereby to bring the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and debaſement upon that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family and Perſon, and in ſhort this taught them to ſupport the miſchiefs they had done, by doing greater, and having murder'd the Poſſeſſor to ſeize upon his Inheritance.</p>
               <p>JUDGE now O Heaven and Earth, Ye Princes and all People how conſiſtent this Doctrine is with the ſafety and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nay the very being of Monarchy, and particularly with that of the Engliſh Nation.</p>

The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians are the only Saints and People of God; The Worſhip and Government of the Church of

I need not: they have done it themſelves by their practice, to the ſhame of not only the Reformation, but even Chriſtianity it ſelf: and indeed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ſo impious and horrible, that I dare not write ſo much abominable Treaſon as it will amount to, though with the perfecteſt horror and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and a deſign to expoſe it <pb n="214" facs="tcp:97680:112"/>to the publick <hi>Odium</hi> of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>NOR is the other Poſition leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous or deſtructive of Monarchy, which places their Right and Title upon the human foundation of Laws and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of any Government; as the Author of a Printed Speech not long ſince publiſhed does, wherein he aſſerts,
<q rend="margQuotes">That he is obliged to this Race of Kings, only by virtue of the Laws of the Land, and no longer than they Govern by thoſe Laws;</q> which is ſo great and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental an error in Politiques, as draws after it innumerable and intolerable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs in the conſequences and practice. For it is not the Law that makes the King, which if it did, might unmake him, but it is the King that makes the Law; and though both for his own and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick intereſt which are inſeparable, he ought to act according to thoſe Laws, which do the more powerfully oblige him by being his voluntary eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the effects of his Will, yet was he a King in his Anceſtors before they were Laws, and would be ſo if they were not at all, or if they were changed by conſent for others. For Monarchy and Government derive their title and <pb n="215" facs="tcp:97680:112"/>Pedigree from an Original much before the Age of the moſt ancient Laws, even from him by whom Kings Reign, the Eternal Monarch of the World.</p>
               <p>AND whereas the Penman of the foreſaid Speech indeavours to confirm his Opinion by a ſmart reflection upon the Engliſh Epiſcopal Clergy, as being the firſt broachers of this Doctrine of the Divine Right of Princes, telling us he does not find that the Romiſh Doctors own it, he is poſſibly better read in Law than in Divinity, otherways he might eaſily have ſatisfied himſelf of the reaſon why the late Romiſh Writers do diſown it, which is becauſe they would veſt the Papal juriſdiction with the ſole Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of a Divine Right, that ſo all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be obliged to borrow their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the fullneſs of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Treaſury: for to affirm that any Prince reigns by Divine Right, abſolutely ruins their great Deſign, ſince being proved, it vacates the pretenſions of the Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him; it being as abſurd to pretend a Supremacy over him who is next to God, as it would be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a King who is ſo, to expect a better Title from any mortal man how great ſoever, than he has from the

               <p>NOR ought this to be fixed upon the Engliſh Clergy as an odious badge of ſervile, officious, or deſigning Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince had they been ſo Principl'd, it lays ſo firm a foundation for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, obedience, the peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the world, it would have been ſo far from being infamous or diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they would have deſerved golden Statues and the eternal gratitude and commemoration of all mankind; but the honour is too great for them, and they are too modeſt to arrogate ſuch a happy invention to themſelves. It is to God himſelf and Chriſt the Eternal Son of the bleſſed, and to his holy Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> that this honour is juſtly due, who being inſpired by the Holy Spirit of God, give this Divine Right to Kings and Government, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Univerſal Obedience to them becauſe they are ordained of God. What was Canonical Scripture to the Primitive Ages muſt be ſo to us, and if Kings had then a Divine Right they have ſo ſtill; and whoever will deny this Doctrine muſt undertake to prove, that thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Commands and Aſſertions were only temporary directions for Obedience;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97680:113"/>and muſt ſhew us when and where they were by Gods command repealed or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded: for no Law can be abrogated but by the ſame or a greater Power than that which did eſtabliſh it; and till this be done, This poſitive divine right of all lawful Powers, will remain a firm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken and immoveable foundation for the Crowns of Princes.</p>
               <p>THEY muſt certainly be the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Crowns who would ſet them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of Monarchs by the totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right of human Laws and pleaſure; and from hence we may conjecture at the <hi>Geneva</hi> kindneſs, for this is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Judgment of all true Presbyterians: and the misfortune of it is, that they who are only ſo as to ſome other Doctrines, but may abhor both this and the practice of it, yet do this miſchief by their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from us and Union with that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that by their numbers they ſwell the Tide, and when it has once broke the Banks of Loyalty and Obedience, then for their own ſecurity, they muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged either to ſwim down the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inundation of Rebellion, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve by oppoſing it when it is too late, to be drowned in thoſe turbulent Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>THAT they believe the People to be above the King which is a fair ſtep towards one, is plain: for they take it for a fundamental of Government and the Liberty of the People, That they may appeal from the King to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as did the Scottiſh Kirk whoſe words are, <hi>That the Parliament ever retained a Juriſdiction in it ſelf both over the Church and Crown;</hi> though as I ſhall ſhew hereafter this is but a Presbyterian wheedle to a Parliament to make them give the King the Mate; and the People I ſay, the Good People are <pb n="219" facs="tcp:97680:114"/>the Men in whom the Supreme Power reſides, that is the Presbyters and Elders aſſembled in the Great Sanhedrim, who repreſent both Church and State, which the Parliament as they would have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmembred of the Epiſcopal Clergy cannot properly do.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Presbytery in reality as great an Enemy to Democracy and Parliaments as to Monarchy. A ſhort view of their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannique Conſiſtorian Government over the Magiſtracy, Clergy, and Laity. Of the latitude and power of ſcandal to draw all affairs into the Conſiſtory. Of their kindneſs to their Enemies. The ſmall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Jeſuit and <hi>Geneva</hi> Presbyter. Both aim at Supremacy.</head>
               <p>THUS have we ſeen that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Supremacy is by its avowed Principles not only inconſiſtent with but deſtructive of Monarchy. Let us examine it a little more ſeverely, and we ſhall find that it is abſolutely inconſiſtent with all Government (except its own oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chique Spiritual Tyranny) and even that adored Democracy,<note place="margin">Presbytery in reality as great an Enemy to Democracy and Parliaments as to Monarchy.</note> which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to hug and embrace with ſo much tenderneſs and affection: and the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which it ſeems to have eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a Parliament which has ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately decoy'd ſome people into that party, is nothing elſe but a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <pb n="241" facs="tcp:97680:125"/>flattery, and temporizing godly fraud: the real deſign is to daſh a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament againſt a King, to break them both in pieces; and like the Ape in the ſtory to make a Cats foot of a Houſe of Commons, to pull the Nut out of the Hot Aſhes of Rebellion into which they ſhall have reduced the Monarchy; for when once by that aſſiſtance they ſhall have procured their own eſtabliſhment they will render it as abſolute a Slave, as they would do Monarchy. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Model of their Conſiſtorian Government, the ſupreme and ultimate underivative Authority is reſient in the High and Mighty Sanhendrim or annual Aſſembly of Presbyters and Elders, to whoſe definitive ſentence a Parliament muſt be ſubordinate; the Authority of that being from Chriſt, the Power of the Parliament being only from the People. For it is not the Perſons or Names, but the ſuperiority of the Authority againſt which this Faction of <hi>Geneva</hi> levels all its aims; and though for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ambitious deſigns, which they vail over with the name of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are pleaſed in words to veſt the Parliament in the name of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and as their Repreſentatives with <pb n="242" facs="tcp:97680:126"/>Authority both over Church and Crown; Yet do they at the ſame time declare, that all men of what degrees, ranks or conditions ſoever, muſt be ſubject to the Scepter of Chriſt, which Scepter they ſay is committed to their hands. So that here is a Yoke ready for the Neck of a Parliament, whoſe intolerable heavineſs has already diſcovered that it is none of Chriſts, but of theſe Modern Scribes and Phariſees who lay heavy burthens upon other Men, but by advancing themſelves into the Chair of Supremacy will not touch them with one of their Fingers. For theſe Saints who pretend to a power of binding Kings in Chains, will without ſcruple ſo claim the honour of ſhackling the Nobles with Fetters of Iron.</p>
               <p>That this is moſt certain, will appear if we conſider that a Parliament can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no right to Government but a Monarch may do the ſame, and upon far better grounds; now you ſee how all their Doctrines veſt the people with a Superiority over Monarchy; the ſame Arts and Arguments which ſubject the Regal Authority to their Will and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, muſt of neceſſity bring a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament within their Power; and it is no more but a <hi>Mutato Nomine de te narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:97680:126"/>fabula,</hi> turn the Tables and they will play the ſame Game at the one as the other: for if a King for oppoſing (which they ſtile perſecuting) them and their ſeditious practices may be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Excommunicated, depoſed, and deprived of his Royal Authority, for the ſame Crimes a Parliament and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Democracy, may be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abrogated, and the ſeveral members of it may by the people be puniſhed with loſs of Life, Eſtate, and all other leſſer puniſhments and diſgraces. And all this muſt be fathered upon the Good People, who ſhall be flattered into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that they have the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when in truth, a few (it may be one) leading politick Presbyters, (who ſhall have gained the Sovereignty over the inferior Clergy, and by their means and the ſeverities of their Diſcipline over all the populace, who muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have their heads tyed under their Uncanonical Girdles) will have under Chriſt the whole management of all the affairs of Church and State, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will venture to dive to the bottom of the Lake of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> wil find the fifth Monarchy of the Church which the Papiſts have ſo long been ſetting up, but <pb n="244" facs="tcp:97680:127"/>by an Earthquake was tumbled in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which the Presbyters are weighing up again, in order to the new trimming it and putting in a better figure, that ſo it may paſs upon the Princes and People of the World, under the Notion of the Scepter of Chriſt; and that it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of Sovereignty under the Colour of Religion at which they aim; and to which whatſoever is an obſtacle, whether King, Parliament, Prelates, Lords or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſhall all be declared Antichriſtian and Unlawful Powers.</p>
               <p>THE little reſpect they have ſhewn to all Parliaments that have oppoſed them, demonſtrates the little value they have either for thoſe Honorable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or their Conſtitution; and they who could pull down the Houſe of Lords becauſe it ſtood in their light, and are ſo eager to diſlimb the Parliament of the Lords Spiritual, cannot in reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to eſteem the lower Houſe further than they frame to themſelves a proſpect that it may be ſerviceable to their preſent Intereſt. I need not go back to fetch inſtances from former times, either in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> of which I could produce a Cloud of Evidences; the rude and inſolent treatment which this preſent
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97680:127"/>Parliament has met with from their blades of the Pen, is a conviction beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: Nor would a new one of which they appear ſo fond, receive any better entertainment at their hands, unleſs to advance the ſlavery of the Nation in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their intereſt, it ſhould imbarque in their deſign.</p>

               <p>THAT they are the true Sons of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> whoſe hands are againſt all Men will in ſhort appear, if we conſider their procedure againſt all ſorts of people, whom they indeavour to reduce to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt by the method of their Conſiſtorian Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Over the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy.</note>WE will begin with the Magiſtracy. If they do not their duty in promoting the Holy Diſcipline, by which name is meant Presbyterian Tyranny of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Miniſters and the Lay Elders over their Pariſhes, of the Claſſis or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery over their Diviſion, and of the <pb n="246" facs="tcp:97680:128"/>yearly Aſſembly over the whole Nation; or much more if they oppoſe it or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any other Church Government, they may and ought to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, depoſed and puniſhed; and the rule is Univerſal as to all, and all manner of Magiſtrates, whether Kings, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Judges, Counſellors, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and ſubordinate Governours. Now what is the duty of the Magiſtrate, and whether he performs this duty as he ought, what means, ways, and methods of Government are conducive to the Salvation of Men, and the good of the Society in order to the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Chriſt, they are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judges; and though they pretend to follow the direction of the Holy Spirit, and the Scriptures, yet will they put their own Interpretation upon them, which though manifeſtly contrary to the conſtruction of the moſt learned men in all Ages, and to the univerſal practice of the Church, as is plain in the Caſe of Epiſcopal Government; Yet herein muſt they be obey'd, under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; and though nothing be more manifeſt that herein their Will is their Law, yet muſt the Magiſtrate as well as the People ſubmit to this Arbitrary Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97680:128"/>premacy, which hereby is manifeſtly veſted in the Presbytery, as to direction, ultimate Judgment, and final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and the ſecular Magiſtrate is no more but the Executioner of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. No Law can be binding which they declare contrary to the great deſign of promoting the Goſpel though by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, violence and tumults: and this intereſt of the Goſpel is in reality their own abſolute Sovereignty. No Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is due to the Magiſtrate further than they aſſure the People, the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded are lawful. To them may be made all appeals even from the higheſt Courts of Judicature. So that down goes Magiſtracy and its Power; or however muſt receive its limits, bounds, meaſures and rules of Government from their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will and determination: So that hereby the Great Aſſembly and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator for the time being is the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſupreme Sovereign Power of the Nation where Presbytery bears the ſway.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus by the Power of the Keys, lockt up the Temporal Sword in their Eccleſiaſtical Scabbard, and made ſure that they will be out of the danger of its Correction; Let us ſee how they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:97680:129"/>manage their Empire and Government towards their Brethren of the Clergy, their friends of the Laity, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of both, ſuch as differ or diſſent from them in Opinion or Practice, though but in the moſt indifferent things.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their Tyranny over the Clergy.</note>It was a ſaying of a wiſe man, That no Government was ſo happy, as where either Kings were Philoſophers, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Kings; and which certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives many of the Spiritual Function, they think and are made believe by the Arch-Presbyters, that thoſe would be Golden and Halcyon days indeed, where Presbyters who are all equal and may hope for a turn in it, ſhould come to have the ſole and ſupreme management of all affairs, and not be ſubject to the temporal Power of the Laity on the one hand, nor the Tyranny of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Hierarchy on the other: but being equal in their Function, calling and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſhould all be Brethren and ſharers of the Common Happineſs of Rule and Government over the People of God: But ſoft my Maſters, leſt a great and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den joy prove dangerous!

The Metropolis or Capital <pb n="249" facs="tcp:97680:129"/>City is the Watch-tower, and the rural Presbyters for all their haſt and the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt not only give the Wall to the grave City divine, but muſt be wholly at the direction and will of the Synod, the Synod at the will of the great Aſſembly, and the Aſſembly at the will of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator and his Faction, during the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in the <hi>Interregnum</hi> of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at the diſpoſal of the virtual Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which is the Grand Cabal in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, who rule the roſt all the year long: the Inferior Presbyters muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch things as he or they ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, teach ſuch Doctrines as they ſhall appoint, uſe ſuch modes, geſtures and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as they enjoin and command, though never ſo much againſt his Judgment or Conſcience: for if he trips never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into a wilful diſobedience, againſt a commanded Punctilio of Opinion or Practice, up goes little <hi>Don</hi> Presbyter's heels, and a more edifying, that is a more ſlaviſh Brother is clapt into his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, unleſs he will openly recant and do Penance at their diſcretion; and if he has a good and inviting Living, let him reſolve either to be a buſtler and buſie ſtickler, and by thoſe Talents exalt <pb n="250" facs="tcp:97680:130"/>himſelf and make a Party, which is the beſt way to be ſecure and ſomebody, or otherwiſe he muſt reſolve to be an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Slave, and by perpetual preſents (which is a very ſafe Tenure and a kind of Poſt Simony) keep in with the top and top Gallant of the <hi>Junto;</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhall be ſure of a remove to a leaner Pariſh. And pray what is now become of the Glorious Parity of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, of the Dear Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Liberty of Propheſying? What difference now betwixt a Lord Biſhop and a Lord Preſident of the Aſſembly, good Mr. Rural Miniſter? Only this, that what the one is falſely ſaid to do, to Lord it over the flock of Chriſt, the other outdoes in reality. Methinks I ſee a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Peters</hi> ſtrutting in <hi>querpo</hi> beaten Velvet like a lofty <hi>Cedar</hi> of Presbytery over-looking and over-ſhaddowing all the little bramble Brethren of the Wood, condemning, reproving, placing, diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, injoining and puniſhing like a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva Maſſanello,</hi> with the wink of his Eye, or the motion of his Finger; and like that Inſolent Fiſherman, wanton with his unbounded and moſt dreadful Power. Then ſhould you hear the groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97680:130"/>Presbyters, and whining Elders, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the heavy burthen of Arbitrary Spiritual Government; and lamenting the loſs of Epiſcopal Liberty. Leaving therefore theſe Ruling Elders and their Lay Brethren, with a ſhaddow of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Equality and Rule, but the ſubſtance of the moſt ſervile ſlavery, let us ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what rate this Government will treat their Friends of the Laity, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious folly they have obtain'd their Dignity and Power.</p>

If your goods commit a rape upon Mr. Elders Corn or Hay, and you will not make him an unreaſonable recompence, 'tis odds but he claws you off with a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> againſt his Elderſhips free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: if a young Lady refuſes Mr. Booby the Elder's Son for a Husband, let her have a care how ſhe converſes with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for if ſhe do he will clap a ſcandal upon her back, which if their tongues be any ſlander, may ſpoil her Reputation and her Marriage as long as ſhe lives, and the report is credited: and in truth ſo great is the Latitude of the Power of Scandal, that I am perſwaded if Virtue her ſelf could be tempted to converſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:97680:131"/>with the Elders, as once the ſurprized

Nay ſo long Ears and Armes has this Scandal, that your Houſe which is your Caſtle, your Table, nor your Bed can be ſecure from it; but if you be ſo indiſcreet to diſcover your follies to your Wife, and ſhe in pet or zeal reveals it to the good Miniſter, he will not fail to make you do publick Penance for your fault and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If you make a contract with a Saint, that is a puling favourite and flatterer of the Presbytery, and he is minded Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to do himſelf a kindneſs call'd cheating you; though you produce Deeds, Evidences, or Speacialties; all's one, if he does but whine out the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a ſcandal of Forgery, and appeal from the rigor of the Law, to the Court of Conſcience, the Equity of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, by their Decree you ſhall loſe not only your money but your Credit too. If a Merchant trade to the Papal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in a time of Famine furniſh them with Corn, he may chance to ſuffer Shipwrack at home, for feeding and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <pb n="254" facs="tcp:97680:132"/>Gods Enemies abroad; and it will never be forgotten what a horrible Sin the tranſporting of Wax from

               <p>SEE now the kindneſs of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; here's a new way to pay old Debts, out of the bank of Scandal. A free trade open'd to inrich the People of the Nation, by forcing them to keep the glut and ſurpluſage of their Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities at home, for fear of Scandal. And indeed there is no Law, Sanction, Action or Profeſſion, Civil or Political, that may not eaſily be brought to be cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable before them, under the notion of Scandal; Nor will there be any Right or Juſtice, but according to the partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their belief of the Integrity of the Parties, that is if they be men of their Intereſt, the affair ſhall be managed in favour of them, in deſpight of Law, Juſtice, Right or Equity.</p>
               <p>AND now my neighbours of the Laity, what think you of Monarchy, and the good old Common and Statute Law, and Epiſcopacy? is not this Scandal the <pb n="255" facs="tcp:97680:132"/>ſervant of the Conſiſtory a more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and troubleſome Fellow, than an Apparitor, or a Pettyfogger?

               <p>FROM the Premiſes of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent frame of Spiritual Government of Presbytery, it is eaſy to conclude, That this Doctrine is every whit as dangerous and deſtructive of Property as Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, of Liberty in the People, as Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Prince or Government. For if it be a good and ſound way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that the Power which can do the greater, can certainly do the leſs, then they who can for any crimes againſt the Law of God, (of which they are the only Judges and Interpreters) take away the Crown and Life of a Prince, the Power and being of a Parliament; may undoubtedly for any ſcandals or offences againſt themſelves and their Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, take away the Life, Liberty, and Property of any private Man: and it is eaſily remembred, and ought never to <pb n="259" facs="tcp:97680:134"/>forgotten, how all thoſe were treated in the Late Times, who were either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, ſuppoſed, or ſuſpected, to be Enemies to the State, as they called that Eaction of a Parliament which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in their Holy League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and though their Friends ſcap't with their lives, their Eſtates paid many Millions Ranſome, for thoſe and their pretended Liberty. It is true ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons were ſtrangely advanced both in Power and Riches; ſo are ſome Pirates and Highway-Men by rich pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and good Booties: but it is all out of the publick ſtock of the Nation, which was juſt ſo much Poorer as they were Richer. Nor had the principal of the Faction any other deſign then, or have they any other now, but their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge or advantage. Diſcontent and Ambition are conſtantly at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Faction and Innovation, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion always at the top: For though theſe men pretend to be the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the Peoples Liberty, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of Religion, they have no real value for the one or the other, further than to ſerve their own deſigns; which is only to wheedle the credulous Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace <pb n="260" facs="tcp:97680:135"/>into their Party: and when by the help and aſſiſtance of their tumultuous Power, the Leaders of Faction are exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Dignity, Riches, and Authority, none are more Arbitrary and Imperious than the one, or greater Slaves than the other.

               <p>And it can be nothing but their ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny in the common People of <hi>England,</hi> who appear ſo inclinable to have a good eſteem of theſe Ring-leaders of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Presbytery, which blinds their Eyes with pretences of Sanctity, from ſeeing that theſe People are the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Enemies they have in the World, who will not permit them quietly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that happineſs which they do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſs under a moſt peaceable and excellent Monarchy and Monarch; but with the Witchcraft of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, fears and jealouſies of Popery, and I know not what fine words to pleaſe Children and Fools, they drill them ſtill
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97680:135"/>on towards the Confines of Rebellion; into which if they do unluckily plunge them, their Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates muſt either fall a Sacrifice to the offended and prevailing Juſtice of their exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sovereign; or become a prey to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Uſurpation, ſhould they happen to be unfortunately victorious; ſo that what ſide ſoever gets the better, they are certain ſtill to be loſers and go by the worſt. For even thoſe perſons to whom they have made themſelves a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool to mount them into the ſupreme Power, will be ſure to keep them down, and trample them underfoot; leſt they ſhould turn to ſome other Party, for the ſame Reaſons and by the ſame Arts, by which they before gained them to be of theirs; there being nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (which theſe men know well enough, and that the People are never contented with their preſent condition) than that a diſcontented Populace, who have made no difficulty to ſhake hands with their Allegiance to their Lawful Prince, will upon the leaſt diſguſt, wheel about, either to their King again, or to any other Power which ſpeaks them faireſt, and bids moſt for their kindneſs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97680:136"/>by promiſes never intended to be kept.</p>
               <p>AND if the Commons of <hi>England</hi> who are infected with this Lunacy of Presbytery, will not be perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, but that all their Prophets muſt have poor <hi>Caſſandra</hi>'s Fate —
<hi>Nunquam credita Teucris,</hi> never to be credited when they ſpeak the greateſt truths, it muſt be, becauſe (to uſe their own word) they are

               <p>SO the Presbyterians firſt blind the common people with pretences of Piety and Liberty, that they may more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely lead them either into certain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, or Democratique Slavery. None ſo bold as blind
<hi>Bayard,</hi> is a great Proverb amongſt the Countrymen; I wiſh they could apply it to themſelves and their preſent circumſtances.</p>
               <p>THAT the practice of theſe People carries a juſt proportion and exact cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence <pb n="263" facs="tcp:97680:136"/>reſpondence to theſe Principles, all their former Actions have manifeſted beyond the poſſibility either of excuſe or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: It would be an ingrateful task to rip up all the tranſactions of the Late Times, and it would be happy for us if they could be ſo buried in the Grave as well as with the Act of Oblivion, as not to afford an Eternal precedent to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, to dance a ſecond Jigg to the ſame tune of theſe py'd Pipers, as 'tis ſaid the Boyes and Girls of a City in <hi>Germany</hi> did after the Rat-Catcher, till they lead them into the Gulph of Ruine; and give occaſion to date a new
<hi>Aera, Anno libertatis amiſſae,</hi> though they ſhould ſay as they did before <hi>reſtauratae.</hi> But it is but too evident that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, Anabaptiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> however in other things they differ'd as to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet they did all agree in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and though in the end they fell out amongſt themſelves, and verified the Proverb, That when Thieves fall out honeſt Men come by their own; yet they were unanimous in the purſuance of thoſe Principles, and all the diſtances in the circumference of Religion, met kindly together in the central point of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97680:137"/>Rebellion: Nor were their odious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices any other thing but a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their belief of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That Kings are inferior to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments and the People, nay to the very fragments, ſhreds, and excrements of a Parliamentary Name. That Subjects may take up Arms againſt them, that they may enter into Leagues, Covenants, Combinations and aſſociations againſt them, and all the reſt before-recited, which I am tir'd with repeating.</p>
               <p>IF the preſent Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not of the ſame Judgment, let them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to the World in a publick
<hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto,</hi> and be ready to ſubſcribe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it with ſacred Oaths, that they do willingly renounce all theſe trayterous Poſitions, and ſeditious Principles and Practices; which is the leaſt vindication they can make for themſelves, the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reparation they can make for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs they have done, and the leaſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and aſſurance they can give to Authority, that they will not do ſo again, or indeavour it: and let their actions go along with their words, that we may believe them; without which, they are ſo low in Reputation, by the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97680:137"/>monſtrous breach of all their Promiſes, Vows, Proteſtations, and ſolemn Oaths to the late King (except the making him a glorious King) that no perſon in his wits, will now take their word any more; ſo that they muſt get their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to become their Sureties, for their good abearing towards the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and all his Liege People.</p>
               <p>BUT inſtead of all this, which is no more than if they mean honeſty toward the Government they would willingly do, they are taking a courſe by their preſent practice, to manifeſt that they are ſtill the ſame Men, and as true to their Principles as ſteel, or as Rebellion is to thoſe Principles; as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to verifie the ſaying of a worthy Gentleman; That men may poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of Presbytery; but Presbytery ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet repented of any thing. And that they are plying their Sails and Oars for a ſecond prize, it is almoſt paſt time of day now to make a doubt; do they not boldly print, and ſpread abroad in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick their ſeditious Pamphlets, Speeches, Letters to their Friends from perſons of Quality, Benchers, and God knows what, who, or where thoſe are? reflecting
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97680:138"/>upon the Government, the great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, the Learned, Pious, and Innocent Biſhops, not ſparing even the King himſelf; with which pocket Piſtols, hand Granadoes, and Fire-balls of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, they indeavour to murder the Government and ſet all into Flames and Combuſtion; peſtering the Country with thoſe pernicious Pamphlets as the City is with their Writers: the deſign of all which reſtleſs Indeavours, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Induſtry, is only to delude the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of theſe Nations; by perſwading them, that they are upon the very brink of Slavery and Ruine, to withdraw them from their Loyalty and Allegiance to their King, and Obedience to the Laws and Government: whenas in truth, no People in the World in humane proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are at a greater diſtance from thoſe imaginary dangers than we, unleſs by believing theſe men and their Principles, we precipitate our ſelves headlong into them: nor is there any thing wanting to render us compleatly happy and ſecure at home and abroad, beſides Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ourſelves, and Loyalty towards our Prince, of both which it is the main deſign of theſe Enemies of our Peace, <pb n="267" facs="tcp:97680:138"/>Proſperity, and Happineſs, at once to rob us; and whoever will take the pains to conſider the riſe, growth, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this Doctrine of Calviniſm, will find it a meer Salamander of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, bred in the Flames of Rebellion, nouriſht with the fire of miſtaken Zeal at beſt, and that it conſtantly delights to dwell in the blaze of Contention. The peace and ſettlement of the Nation are its utter Enemies and oppoſites, and no wonder then if the Patrons of it are the Enemies of our Peace; and as a Pope once ſaid to <hi>Charles</hi> Brother to the French King, concerning
<hi>Conradine</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> (which gave him his Death) The Life of <hi>Conradine</hi> is the Death of

                  </note> and the Death of <hi>Conradine</hi> is the Life of <hi>Charles:</hi> ſo may we truly ſay; The Peace and Unity of our Monarchy is the Death and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Presbytery; and the Death of Presbytery is the Life of Monarchy: which is the true reaſon why they ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for their Life, to keep up diſcords, differences and animoſities; and (it may be) are all of the ſudden become ſo Zealous for a Foreign War, the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Plot having put them out <pb n="268" facs="tcp:97680:139"/>of hopes of one at home. So long as the Government is but buſie, and the Crown neceſſitous, they do not only think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure, but are in hopes, that the expences, or unforeſeen accidents of War, may at laſt occaſion differences at home; upon which ill humors of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, like Plagues and Gangrenes, they always feed and increaſe, and hope in the end to prove fatal to it; for they know by experience, that <hi>Corruptio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nius eſt Generatio Alterius;</hi> A dead Monarchy fly-blown by Presbytery, breeds the ſhort-liv'd Maggots of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Common-wealth. But theſe things have been ſo well taken notice of, and their whole Intrigue diſcovered, by the charitable hand of the Author of the two Pacquets of Advices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that a clearer expoſing of them, is altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>IT is the wiſhes, prayers, and hopes, of the beſt ſubjects of theſe Nations, that the dangerous noiſe and clamours which they make themſelves, will oblige Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to take notice of them, and their miſchievous intentions; and that this very Parliament which they fear and therefore hate with all their Hearts; (as <pb n="269" facs="tcp:97680:139"/>is plain by their Ringing ſo loud its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Bell, and perſwading the World it is Dead, that their Cruelty may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Revenge of burying it alive) will take notice of ſuch an affront to a King and his Parliament as no Age can parallel, nor any perſons be guilty of but Presbyterians; and offer ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients according to their Wiſdom and Prudence, to eaſe the Loyal and faithful Subjects, amongſt which they challenge the firſt rank themſelves, of thoſe juſt fears and jealouſies, and thoſe uneaſineſſes which afflict them, by reaſon of the growth, increaſe, and confidence of theſe implacable, malicious, ſanguinary, and reſtleſs Antimonarchical, and Anti-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary ſpirited People and their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>TO conclude; From the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe theſe neceſſary conſequences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Some neceſſary conſequences from the former Diſcourſe.</note>Firſt, That no perſon whatſoever, let him pretend never ſo much Religion, Sanctity or Innocence, can poſſibly be a good Subject, ſo long as he continues a true Presbyterian, or of their off-ſpring; in regard they always carry about with them as the main of their Religion, ſuch <pb n="270" facs="tcp:97680:140"/>Principles as are directly contrary to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and deſtructive of Loyalty; to which he can never be a firm, true, and aſſured Friend, who owns a Power Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of his Prince within his Dominions; and that ſuch a Power may of right depoſe him, and take away his Crown and Life, which has been proved to be the avowed Doctrine of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorians of <hi>Geneva, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> both in Print and Practice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no Monarch can be ſafe, or his beſt Subjects at eaſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ſo long as this faction is either owned, tolerated, permitted, or favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, publickly or privately within his Dominions; eſpecially the Ring-leaders of the Party, which guilded Snakes can no ſooner be warm in the Boſom of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, but they begin to hiſs and ſting; and are conſtantly either the Whiſperers or Trumpeters of Sedition and Rebellion, the very practice of what they call their Religion in prohibited Conventicles, and Aſſemblies, being but the younger Brothers of Tumults and Inſurrections, and Rebellion againſt the King and Government, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, in a demure dreſs and garb <pb n="271" facs="tcp:97680:140"/>of Innocence; which is ſo far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it better than that in the Field, with Drums and Colours, that it renders it worſe; becauſe more dangerous and apt to deceive; many people being willing to become Volunteers to the Pulpit, as <hi>Hudibras</hi> calls it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The drum Eccleſiaſtick,</l>
                  <l>When beat with fiſt inſtead of a ſtick.</l>
                  <note place="margin">Hudibr. Cant. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>
               </q>
               <p>Who would not liſt themſelves into open and barefac't Rebellion till from thence they hear the dreadful thunder of a Curſe ye
<hi>Meroz;</hi> or The Sword of the Lord and of <hi>Gideon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND let them not call this neceſſary Caution for the publick and all honeſt mens preſervation, the effect of a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Spirit; ſince though they may charge the Government with Cruelty, it is they who are cruel to themſelves and the whole Community, by being evil doers, buſie bodies, ſeditious, trayterous, heady, high minded, oppoſers of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, diſturbers of Order, Enemies to our Peace, Unity, and Happineſs, and to the very Fundamental Laws, Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, Conſtitution, and whole Frame
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:97680:141"/>of the National Government both in Church and State.</p>
               <p>I appeal to all the Records of time, both our own and of other Nations, which will witneſs, That whoever did act thus contrary to the publick Intereſt, have in all Ages, in all Places, by all Laws and Perſons in Authority, been eſteemed juſtly and deſervedly puniſhed, as being the common miſchiefs of nature, directly oppoſite to the ſecurity and happineſs of all mankind in general; not excepting themſelves out of the number, whoſe reſtleſs, uneaſie, diſcontented humor, certainly renders them the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate of all humane race, becauſe ever moſt unquiet and unpleaſed, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed utterly uncapable of ſatisfaction; the conceſſions and condeſcenſions of Authority to day, emboldening them to demand greater tomorrow: and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence being ſo far from making them grateful, that it gives them the pain to invent new Requeſts, their deſires being therefore boundleſs and unlimited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they neither know poſitively what they would have, nor are able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what it is that will ſatisfie them.</p>
               <p>I appeal to their own practice when <pb n="273" facs="tcp:97680:141"/>in Power; That this is a great, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and Univerſal Truth, That Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government is not to be diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Lawful Commands: but that therefore the Violators of Laws, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Principal, ought for example, and <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to feel the force and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe Laws they break: ſince to be merciful to thoſe few, were to be cruel to the whole Body of the Society, and to ruine the very Foundation of all Government. For what was it, that brought ſo many Noble Heads to the infamous Scaffold, and ſome Iluſtrious Lives to moſt ignominious Deaths? was it not for tranſgreſſing their Ordinances, oppoſing their Way, Government and Uſurpations, in defence of the Ancient, Eſtabliſht, Fundamental Laws, Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Rights and Liberties, both of the Prince and People? What was Juſtice, Prudence, and of neceſſity to be done by them, for the ſafety and ſupport of their ill-gotten Dominion, muſt much more be ſo now; unleſs they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that their Power was Lawful, but the preſent is not: which how good ſoever their will may be, and though it appears to be what they believe and aim <pb n="274" facs="tcp:97680:142"/>at, yet they will never be able to prove, by Law, Reaſon, or Religion; and I hope they will never be in the Capacity to demonſtrate it a ſecond time by force and violence, the rude and compulſive Logick of the Sword or Cannon Law.</p>
               <p>Laſtly it follows, That this generation of Men the Presbyters with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, are never to be truſted, but upon the Demonſtration of their ſincere Repentance and Converſion, atteſted by their Actions; in regard that whoſoever owns a Power Superior to his Prince, does at the ſame time find an eaſie refuge and evaſion againſt all the verbal Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances he can give, or that can be taken of him, that he will be a good Subject. For no perſon can oblige himſelf to an inferiour Power, againſt the Right of a Superior: for if a Country Juſtice of the Peace, a Judge of Aſſiſe, a Deputy or a Vice-Roy, ſhould exact any ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or promiſes of fidelity from any Perſons, or by threatnings and ſeverities compel them to give ſuch, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the King his Lawful Superior in Power, there is no Perſon but knows, that the one having no lawful Authority to require it, nor the other to conſent to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:97680:142"/>give away the Right of his Prince over him, all ſuch Actions, Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt therefore be as null and void, as if I ſhould promiſe to give the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to the King of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is the plain Caſe, The King (as with good reaſon for his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the ſafety of the publick he may) expects aſſurances from theſe People, they for fear of the Laws, make ſome faint promiſes (for an Oath of Allegiance to renounce their Trayterous Poſitions is too binding to be taken) with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That the Presbytery, or Popular Authority, is ſuperior to the King; and that therefore he has no juſt right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch promiſes and aſſurances from them, to the prejudice of that ſupreme Power, nor they to give it away; and that therefore, they are not binding <hi>in foro Conſcientiae;</hi> but being prejudicial to the right of ſuch a Power as may call him to an account, and by the Grand Charter of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> both free them from all ſuch Obligations, and puniſh him for exceeding his limits, by intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their native right of being a free-born People, all ſuch ſtipulations being forced and violent, the effects of <pb n="276" facs="tcp:97680:143"/>fear, without the conſent of the will, are therefore null and void. And their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſpeak this Language, however their Tongues may ſometimes ſeem to be of ſo ill breeding as to give them the Lye, by proteſtations of great Kindneſs, Love, and I know not what to his Majeſty and the Government; of which they are in ſome humours prodigal enough, only to deceive the credulous and cover their ill deſigns.</p>
               <p>LET them not therefore think to deceive us by the ſmooth flatteries of ſoft words, their uſual blandiſhments and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Innocence, and that they mean us no more harm than they do their own Souls; which is true in their ſenſe; for they would have us believe that it is much for our advantage to be ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true Fond and Baſis of Popular, or Conſiſtorian Supremacy. If they do believe theſe Principles, we cannot be too ſecure againſt their dreadful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequences; and if they do not believe them, let us ſee it in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by a hearty ſubmiſſion to the King and his Laws and Government Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and Civil, and let them never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the obſtacle of Conſcience; for if <pb n="277" facs="tcp:97680:143"/>they were as really tender againſt Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, as they are againſt Loyalty, they might, nay they muſt do this, without prejudice to the moſt nice and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous amongſt them; nor can they refuſe to do it, if they mean honeſtly, and to keep a Conſcience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and all Men. And if they perſiſt in the refuſal of giving this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique, and only creditable teſtimony of their Innocence and Loyalty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinately in the old road of their former practices, no perſon can judge, but that they are ſtill managed by the ſame deſperate Principles; and though it is eaſie to determine (from their own methods upon all that oppoſed them when in Power) what they deſerve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrictneſs of the <hi>Lex Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionis;</hi> yet I will not pretend to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy what they will receive: they know by Experience, (which ought to have had another effect upon them, and not this diſ-ingenuous encouragement which they have taken from it) that our Government is mild and gentle, and has not taken any of its meaſures towards them, from their proceedings. But this they may aſſure themſelves, that their
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:97680:144"/>actings are too hot to hold long; and they drive on too furiouſly in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate deſigns: the duſt which riſes in ſuch Clouds will give notice that their Troops are upon a haſty march, and that the Conſpirators of the zealous Reformer <hi>Jehu</hi> that furious driver, are mounted in the Chariot of Rebellion, which is drawn by the wild Horſes of Ruine and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I deſire, that all Judicious, Sober, and conſidering perſons will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice and partiality, weigh in the juſt ballance of ſacred Truth and convincing Reaſon, whether the fore-mentioned Principles do not infallibly lead to the fatal conſequences which have been ſhewn? and if I have not been able to accompliſh ſo great an affair as clearly to demonſtrate the truth of it, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is in my underſtanding, not in my will, and therefore may be my affliction, but can never be my Crime. However, I flatter my ſelf with the hopes of having the pleaſure to ſee this ſmall Eſſay, give encouragement to ſome other hand which is furniſhed with more ability, better opportunities and advantages, than my preſent circumſtances will allow me,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97680:144"/>to evidence the greatneſs of theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truths; and to give finiſhing ſtrokes to this piece, which I have according to my talent only rudely deſigned; and though to ſome it may poſſibly appear too rough and bold, yet the Maſters of the Pencil ſay, that freedom is no fault where it draws to the Life; The imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are my own, and no perſon ſhall be more ready to charge me with them, than I ſhall be, not only to own them, but to indeavour to correct and amend them; and from how inconſiderable a Perſon ſoever it comes, <hi>Saepè &amp; olitor eſt valdè opportuna locutus;</hi> Fools and Children ſpeak Truth, nor is it, or ought it to be leſs conſiderable becauſe it comes from them: yet let it be remembred, That Presbyterian Popular Conſiſtorian Supremacy, is, and ever will be, the unchangeable, irreconcilable Enemy, of Monarchy, Law, Liberty, Peace, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and the true Proteſtant Catholick Religion.</p>
